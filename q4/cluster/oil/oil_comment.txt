oil servicing is not done properly as they do not clean properly .
for cleaning , they use some kind of oil spray for cleaning .
so due to this oil in the dashboard of mats is remained .
i told them to change car oil and do normal services they send me there place .
when oil servicing the car they are not properly looking after the cleanliness .
a scratches occurs in right side of the car while oil servicing this need to be improved .
once i had given car for servicing and mentioned regarding the oiling and ac repair service .
if we ask for oil change but oil is good or little down , they should top up that oil .
they just change the oil and other work remained the same .
after servicing on met they put oil or wax and it was looked new .
