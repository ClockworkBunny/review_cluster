they damaged my tire the employees always keep on changing due to which there is lack of knowledge
as i am not much aware of the car i don t know that what is to be done if there is break issue or tire is punctured .
upper side tire is all good .
in my case the rare wheel came out of the left side tire base and that time i pleaded them please and somebody to take my vehicle to nearer work shop or service center then they said that your service is out of warrantee so i said that i will pay for that no problem i will pay for it please help me out but nobody helped me out they have not given me any excellent service i myself had to take my vehicle to 5000 to10000km to their service center then they made it ready then i took off .
they not clean dust board , carpet a tire was not clean .
tire bottom and down platform was not clean properly .
tire tube was punchier and all air was leaked out .
suppose now it is summer season but in monsoon , it is create big problem because it is do n't some bottom side may be possibility chesses will be glitterested , second thing they have not having facilities for balance alignment of the tire at showroom .
some soil is there under the tire .
