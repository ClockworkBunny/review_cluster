instead they should keep the engine for drying in the closed room .
they should have good engineers and technology to service the car .
proper engineer is not there at this service .
engineer should be clean it .
they should be clean car engine also
if i go for long drive then my engine would be failed .
my car run 16000 km i completed my 3 servicing if i see engine it feel like car is very old .
they should clean the vehicle properly and should concentrate on the cleaning of engine
there was a leakage in the engine of my car , so when told about this they asked me to tell the issue in the next servicing .
diesel engine have lots of different if we put new of old it won t feel changes .
my car engine also not clean when i told to them to clean it but they not did the same .
