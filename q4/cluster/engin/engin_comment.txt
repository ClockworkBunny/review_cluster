in the cleaning process they clean the engine keep the engine for drying in the open space so due to this dust mud is collected in the engine .
so even after cleaning the engine dust is collected .
instead they should keep the engine for drying in the closed room .
when customer said my car is washing like bonnet and engine is there .
they should have good engineers and technology to service the car .
proper engineer is not there at this service .
engine was dusty so they said we cannot wash engine .

in body engine they are not did properly on water service .
i visit the service centre for water service they did not service properly at bottom engine .
not properly servicing my car also my car engine not properly washed .
they should clean the vehicle properly and should concentrate on the cleaning of engine
i mentioned that engine wash from outside was not properly .
so , engine should be washed properly .
if we look the engine dust remains the same .
