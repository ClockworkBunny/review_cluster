the supervisor should take care about each and every single problem because last time they had not properly cleaned my vehicles .
we have to tell service advisor that do cleaning here and there and after that they do cleaning well .
there is no supervisor who can see properly even the manager is also not good .
manager of tata is nice he manage good .
the area manager was telling its happen we are staying in india we are not in foreign the word which they told should not suppose to say .
manager should after all this .
service advisors are not proper .
proper advisors are not there in this dealership .
supervisor should be properly monitoring the washing service .
service advisor also was present there .
they are not washing our cars , we told the manager they also not response to us .
they should appoint one service manager over there to improve the services .
management should be improved .
advisor of cleanliness should little bit take care .
the supervisor should be up to date , like before giving the car back he should properly cleaned washed or not .
last service time i told to the manager , he promised me next service we doing properly , but they did as it is only
at the time of washing the car they should provide one supervisor .
the car should be checked by a senior supervisor .
their manager should checked the car properly like cleanliness was done proper or not .
they should improve their management as it is in poor condition .
3 \) they have to provide supervisors .
cleanliness of car are very poor , we pay for cleanliness for our car , so if we tell anything to them about cleanliness then they told , our advisor which way told us like that we do .
washing needs to be good the advisor who takes the car for servicing .
management should improve their responsibilities .
so customer don t have to complaint about the work their should be one advisor or supervisor who look after the work .
