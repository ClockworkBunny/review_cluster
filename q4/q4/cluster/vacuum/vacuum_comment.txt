in aravalli dealership they don t have vacuum cleaner .
vacuum cleaning process should be properly done .
inside the car vacuum cleaning properly do .
when they gave me the vehicle , they did n't vacuum it .
so next time they should not forget to vacuum the car .
vacuum should be doing proper and polishing also .
because in last servicing also didn t used vacuum .
after the work they have told me that they washed my car with the vacuum cleaner but i have seen that they did not use vacuum cleaner they use blowing wind .
the vacuum is not proper .
they do n't do proper vacuum for seats .
