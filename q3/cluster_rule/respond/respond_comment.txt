they should respond according to response from customers . they should provide the results considering customer outputs . then check if customer is happy or not , required output was given or not etc .
workshop staff and supervisors don \? t cooperate with each other . mechanical person doesn \? t listen anything to supervisor which i have seen by myself that supervisor told them to work properly but mechanic did not listen to him . supervisor don \? t check car if mechanic person says vehicle is done so he gave us vehicle without checking . we customer face issue by their internal problems . they should appoint a person on supervisor who is neutral and speak clearly with everyone . all are young generation so they keep fighting regarding their work .
they should first listen completely to the customers then give the answer accordingly . if we are complaining on any issue they should work on that .
