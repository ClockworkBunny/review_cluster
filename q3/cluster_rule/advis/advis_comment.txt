when we go there they themselves did not check the car , they asked parties about the issues in car . even after asking to the parties they should check car because they might not know parts . they are solving issues whatever parties is saying but they should also pay attention on other parts . they should advise us that this part is poor and we need to replace it so should we replace it or not . just i had done servicing and my car is making noise so they should upfront tell us . they did not give explanation .
they should advise properly . they should check everything after that if you find any issue this is wrong . .
there should be an experience advisor . this people are not having it . and the advisors are not having much knowledge and they were asking to us . if we asked them to do the work they should complete the work and should satisfied us . every one is ready to give their advise . if customer is satisfied then he will give the feedback happily . i am not satisfied with your millennium toyota which is on klayan shil phata road . i am satisfied with thane 's toyota . here people are not much older . we are getting all families in thane .
service advisor should give unbiased advice to the customer as they suggest us something else in 1 service and sudden on next service they suggest us something else , they should have objective criteria for advisers , they should check the vehicle properly at the time of servicing .
they don \? t know what they are advising to us . we have to explain them what is the actual problem . if we have any problem but they got any other problem , then they did not listen to us . my car engine is making noise that also i had to told him .
customer should get right advise which is not getting . they do n't have the idea about the car . like how to drive the fortunar car so the maintenance and mileage will increase . they should have all the information .
whenever we take our car for servicing the service advisors there do not advise us properly . what they do is suppose any part of the car is working fine they will ask us to change that part . part that is supposed to be changed is not done which the owner also know there is some defect . give proper training to service advisor and tell them they have to be friendly with customers . they must focus on what customer is telling .
advisor talk rudely . should talk properly . time does not know how much time it will take for servicing . for 10 minutes work they take 4hrs . they should give proper advise .
in my vehicle there was ac related problem . it \? s not solving yet . they kept my vehicle for four day 's either then the adviser should checked properly , what problem in ac .
when i visited their service center that time i was completed my 70 , 000 km . that time service advisor self advise me after 5 6 thousand km you should change your break paddle . when you complete 5000 or 6000 km then visit again that time we will change it . when i was visit after completed my 5000 km to their service center then i remembered they told me after 5000 km they will change my cars break paddle . but that time service advisor told me your break paddle is in still good condition . we will change it when you completing your another 5000 km . when i visited after completing my 70 , 000 km that time if they properly estimated or advise how long break paddle where in good condition . if they give wrong estimated or wrong advice customer not comfortability drive the vehicle . they should be properly estimate or give correct advice to the customer .
one staff member given my proper advise and staff not given me proper advise he did n't explained me properly . they told me your bill will come something amount but we get some other amount in bill . so they should told us exact amount they told me to changed raile so i told them to changed it then they changed it but they did n't returned my old raile . when i asked about it they said it was not there .
they should advise the customer how to improve the performance of the vehicle .
they should sound technical . they should clearly tell the customers what was the problem in the vehicle even they should give genetic advise to the customers .
they should correct advise to the customers
rishi toyota service center had not explained me or haven \? t advise me about my car problem . they haven \? t advised me the interior major problem . they haven \? t explained the car problem or technical problem because of that the problem a raised . they should check technically and then they should discuss with the customer .
commercial toyota service center service advisor always are in hurry so they did n't talk toyota . customer so much service advisor should give proper advise to a customer like what servicing wane car when require change in it such kind of thing they should inform to a customers .
when we go there then they only asked that car have any problem \? in car have no so much excess problem but if we have doubt for some little things another then we want some technician advise , so there are our person so you can ask him like when people gone there , so there should be have normal technical advisor which provide us advise . i got an outside , when we put 1000 1500 diesel that time in starting mix a oil because of it overage is good engine work properly , such kind of small thing and doubts we known from an outside persons . such thing no body told us to your side they was take direct car key and car also and gone an inside after that they call me and said your car was ready , take your key and give me your gate pass and go from there if in my car have some major problem then we report on counter but if i have small problem , so that time nobody available there for this they should kept someone , so if will good for us . if someone car go there , so in your side someone and ask \? sir \? you want to ask something another then any advise you want to give or any suggestion you want so such 4 5 small thing we should ask to him . on there i have some technical doubts like in my car have auto meter which is not work properly and in car show fuel average , so if i want to ask about some technical and in my car which have button or switches , how to use it . there is have no any technical assistant to guide us , specially when we purchase new car , so in first servicing we want someone who give us advise like you should also put one more filter on upside . this thing i know to local mechanic such kind of small things to tell us there have no any person . if we will get technical advisor so it will good . i didn \? t get service advisor or technician number if i got a number so it will good for ask small small doubts . if in my car engine have some problem and also some noise are come so call to technician advisor and ask him to what to do another then at least when we go indorepur for car servicing so we can call and ask who technician provide me service in that time till now i didn \? t get any number if i got technical assistance regularly so in one year i will comfortable to use car because i drive my slowly , i didn \? t drive my car so fast .
