if the service advisor makes any commitment then they must fulfill their commitments or at first only tell us if you cannot do it
service center people do not know that how time it would take for servicing so they do not commit the customers . they should tell the customers about the time taken for the service . they should check the availability of their technician their work load . they should also check if the servicing is done properly or not .
there are taking more time . they should give car on committed time . they are giving after 2 3 hours of committed time .
they should improve their behavior . commitments should be followed . customers should be respected . we have purchased car by paying money , we are not thief .
