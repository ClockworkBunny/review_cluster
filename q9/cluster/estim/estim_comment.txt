i think if they first held a meeting with customer about whatever work is there , they have been given an overall estimate but instead of doing this , if they will give each details of each parts then , it would be better and the matter will be clear .
they should give us an estimate value .
while servicing the estimate amount which will be charged will be 8000rs they said after once the wok will be done they will call us and inform about the same .
because they said estimate amount will be 8000rs actual amount charged was 12000 to 13000rs .
actually i have just few crashes front of my car and only for few crashes i have paid 4000rs it is not easy for normal people and now i have some other problem with my car back light when i have given to the estimate the estimate is about 40000 how can i afford it the normal people cannot afford this much amount .
estimate has to be taken after completing the work .
