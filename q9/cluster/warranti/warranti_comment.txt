you giving one year servicing so they should be extend servicing warranty for 5 years like that .
they are not telling what is the exact problem in even car is on warranty they harass the customer take false changes
warranty should be correct .
then it makes no meaning of warranty .
whatever , the car parts may be they need to give warranty of 1 to 2 years .
they extended the warranty period for that they charged 12000rs .
