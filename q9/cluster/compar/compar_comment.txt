i was planning to purchase tires of green stone brand but there is difference of rs .
this difference should not be there .
why such a big difference
there is big difference .
in your service and out side service if you reduce only 40 then also it will be extraordinary amount of difference .
when i went to buy car dealership staff said parts of toyota vehicles are cheapest compare to other .
in compare to other cars toyota has costly parts .
1000 for changing the mirror such type of difference are there as if they would have said truth i would have changed it immediately but i had to ride with the broken glass almost for the 6 months as i was not sure including the insurance so that kind of serious imbalances are there as i thing the quality of customer balance is been reduced as toyota business is grown up their sales have been increased all are much busy so the initial quality has gone down .
whatever charged they are taken on that compare they are not reduced the amount .
any customer thinks that we have save at least 2 rs but there is difference of 700 to 800 rs .
suppose we get 1000 from outside but in show room 1200 so this is the difference .
compare to others so it should be reduce .
air filter is very costly in service centre compare to an outside
