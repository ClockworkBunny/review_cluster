general checking is ok but what checking is done we do not understand at all .
technicities should check if this is working then they not should force or suggest us to replace .
they have to check the audio system mode
they must check the car properly .
if customer is giving for servicing then it is your responsibility to check completely .
there are 2 major services 1 check up is there .
i had not faced any major problem in this car servicing is just because engine and all part should check once .
last time i had given car for serving i thought of alignment but they did not check it .
they have to check the speed brakes while servicing .
they should be air check .
when we are giving car to then they should check the car properly they give detail about expenses .
instead of replacing parts toy should check what all measures can be taken to increase life of parts by some minor repairing 's .
