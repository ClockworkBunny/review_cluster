i took toyota insurance for rs .
all this should have been covered under insurance .
periodic and insurance requirement should be update time to time .
they are taking 4000 5000 when we claim the insurance
they should reduce the insurance of car .
insurance of fortuner is now around 60 , 000 70 , 000 .
insurance must be get on servicing .
it should be minimum , if we changed our cars parts , insurance are immediately not claimed .
the insurance of fortuner is now around 60 , 000 70 , 000 .
if any problem , they only give 70 of the amount as insurance .
they must give 90 as insurance .
after order we discuss about that parts and when insurance will be complete so it takes too much time for customer and because of this our feedback is spoiling and name of company name is also getting spoiled .
taken long time for insurance for my car .
if i have to service , my car by paying for such things and service it then why i need an insurance .
vehicle having 100 insurance .
insurance is from dealership that time i ca n't go again and again .
full insurance needs to be covered .
