hence , customers are getting difficult to reach the dealership shop .
should have a body shop at the dealership location .
there are no shops available near to that areas that we can buy something to eat .
at the dealership location there is no available body shop .
so we have go kondapur for body shop .
they have to provide the body shop at harsha toyota nizampet
location of the shop should be on the road .
work shop should be open near ponto sahib city .
nearest shop is not available we have to go so far for that .
service centre should be near the highway this service centre is long from my home an shop service centre should be happen inside the city otherwise they should be increase pickup and drop service centre has 5km far this should be happen at least 2 and 3 km and also there have less drivers
there is no paint shop showroom .
hence the toyota dealership need to relocate their dealership shop in city \( town \) area .
if they could arrange to come to different town like movable service center , we have lots of toyota car here , if they come for servicing after every six months or one year , they do not have to open a shop but if they come then it would be nice .
the other shops of wasan is in govandi and vashi and it is odd for us to travel till there .
in navsari should be have location for work shop for emergency work in navsari have any workshop so there should also open a workshop honda or suzuki workshop had in navsari but there had no any toyota workshop for compton so toyota should open a worship indifferent different location in navsari .
they should open work shop at makhmallabad it will be good for the customer .
harsha thiruvallur dealership the body shop work and all facilities of work should be available , then it will be good .
