should have a body shop at the dealership location .
toyota market value is good but they should be open more service center .
it should be in the market
there are no shops available near to that areas that we can buy something to eat .
because it is near to the market area .
at the dealership location there is no available body shop .
so we have go kondapur for body shop .
they have to provide the body shop at harsha toyota nizampet
location of the shop should be on the road .
it should be available in market area .
location should be in market .
there should be market nearby so customer feel good .
nearest shop is not available we have to go so far for that .
service centre should be near the highway this service centre is long from my home an shop service centre should be happen inside the city otherwise they should be increase pickup and drop service centre has 5km far this should be happen at least 2 and 3 km and also there have less drivers
they should pay attention on market location visibility they should improve it .
there is no paint shop showroom .
some spare parts price is too much as compared to market price .
the spare parts in market is low price as compared to toyota price .
nanavati toyota should open dealership at patia textile market area or at vadodara city side because current location is too far .
if they could arrange to come to different town like movable service center , we have lots of toyota car here , if they come for servicing after every six months or one year , they do not have to open a shop but if they come then it would be nice .
the other shops of wasan is in govandi and vashi and it is odd for us to travel till there .
harsha thiruvallur dealership the body shop work and all facilities of work should be available , then it will be good .
