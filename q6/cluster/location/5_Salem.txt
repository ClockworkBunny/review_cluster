Increase the Dealership branches in Salem to Melur areas.
Dealership location is in between to Salem  & Namakkal. If it is in Salem then it will be good.
The service center should be open at Salem city it will be fine for us.
There should be a dealership in Salem Arthur it will be good; in Arthur Salem will be easy for the customer to deal with the problem.
I am staying at Hosur. It the dealership is at Dharamapuri or Krishnagiri then it will be good. For going to Salem the charges are high. We are paying for toll naka. Times are wasted. Bangalore charges are so Hosur is easy for us. But the charges are very high in Hosur.
