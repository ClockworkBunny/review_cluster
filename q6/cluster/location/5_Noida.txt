Dealership location is far. It should be in greater Noida its ok for us. Its takes only 50 km of us.
Which the location is this, which away to the Noida & always Ghaziabad. Location should be like this, were people has to face any problem. Like they have no problem to come back. Like it should behave in greater Noida or Sector-71.
Location is far away from me. In Noida there should be 2 or 3 more service center. Service center location should be at nearby  5 km.
Location was far for me. Uttam Toyota has 3 showrooms it is in papad gunj and Noida. Noida has only service option. If papad gunj has a workshop then we do not want to go to Noida.
They should change the location because it is very inside. it should be and main location like grater Noida or uttam Toyota the center should be at famous place. we use to travel 14km to reach the location .The location needs to change near grater Noida and it should be at main road.
