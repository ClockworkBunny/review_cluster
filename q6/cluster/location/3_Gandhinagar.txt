I personally think that, they should open service center in Gandhinagar because Ahmedabad is very far for us. If we have any minor problem after service. We have to waste whole day for servicing. If service center will be in Gandhinagar we can give our vehicle to service center and go to our work. Service center is in Ahmedabad, so it?s not possible for us to go to dealership on working days. There was some noise in my speakers which I want to repair but I don?t have time for visit Ahmedabad for speaker?s issue so it will be good if they open service center at Gandhinagar.
Dealership location needs to change. Infinium Toyota needs improvements about that. Infinium Toyota is located in traffic area from both side. We have to cross whole city of Gandhinagar or we have to go to Ring road for dealership. Dealership location should be at some better place.
If Infinium Toyota will come little far then it will be better for us. Now current location is little fa. Gandhinagar is Capital of Gujrat and if dealership comes under capital of Gujrat then it will be better for us. All other car?s service center are only 5-7 kilometer far from Gandhinagar but Infinium Toyota is around 25-30 kilometer far from us. We have to think before purchasing vehicle that we have to travel 25-30 kilometer for service. So maybe people are not buying Toyota products because in the starting I was also able to buy Toyota car but I was not buying because of service center. I was thinking like who will go to Ahmedabad for service and we cannot do service at any other station. Then I was strongly thinking to buy this car. So I purchased this car. If service center will be locate here, then I may purchase this car 5 year ago. Other everything is good about service only location should be in Gandhinagar city.
