The location of dealership is beside of highway. It would be better if the location of dealership would be some another city side of Chennai bypass road or Thanjavur road .
The dealership location is 110 km far from my house. I want to go for Chennai . I should be there in near sengalpatt . It should be better for us.
Harsh dealership is there in Chennai but there are so less and many of them are outside one more harsh dealership should be there in ECR or OMR road it will be good.
Chennai Nandhanam dealership to located in one-way road. It is not visible from road if it is skipped the dealership have to take very long-route to find dealership. It is very difficult to find dealership
