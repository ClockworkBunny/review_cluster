We have to go to Satara for servicing. Service center  should be in Karad because we have to go 52 kms.
There should be sub-center in Karad. Earlier there were only 5 cars but now in Karad there are more than 50 plus. From here we have to travel 55 kms from Karad to reach here.
In Karad district many people use Toyota brand. I stay at Karad & DSK is 50 km far away. So there should be one service station of Toyota as I think.
I stay at vita but service center location should be at Karad or Sangli it is fine as per my wish.
