When the car is left for servicing at that time the difficulties that we face must be changed. Some where they should open the service station where all facilities are available. They must keep pickup and drop. I have Maruti car when we go there they give us alternate car for use. They say 2 days? time is required. This is our showroom car. We have swift, swift desire, alto they arrange for their person to drop. From this you understand that how much they care for us. They take responsibility to drop us at home. Your showroom does not have anything as such. Service department must be changed. Sharayu Bavdan are all on highway side. They should be in the city. Plant must have all the facilities like of Mahindra. They must perform like that.
The location is far from where I stay it should get changed .If it could be near then it would be nice .DSR servicing is not there at PCMC . Pick up drop happen . But physically we want to go then they do not come at PCMC or Pimpri Chinchwad . If pimpri service station get opened so it will be profitable. Here there is Sharayu Toyota showroom but we don't knee much about it .We like DSR servicing .
Sharayu Toyota should open one more dealership we have to go 55km far away. now  which have sharayu Toyota, Which have in south goa.So one more service center also should be open in an exchange south on where have our residence because from there we have to come.55km to 60km far away for servicing so they should open a servicing center to 30km far their sharayu Toyota service center, Because we live an far away .We have to waste our full day for servicing.
