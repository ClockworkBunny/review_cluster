Dealership is in Bikaner so it should be in district Churu.
Dealership is located in Bikaner and it?s too far. Yes, the dealership gives pick up and drop services but it would be good if they locate their dealership in city area. Other brands like HUNDAI?s are located in City area.
Location should be in market. Bikaner station is so far. There is no restaurant & no hotel over there.
I went Bikaner it is far from me. When I returned then companies staffs are dropped me their car, but when I went there while taken away my own vehicle. If I hired private Rickshaw or other vehicle then it charges I had to pay 300 or 400 rupees. How they pick up us like that only they should drop us at Sagarpada. Then we will fully satisfy.
