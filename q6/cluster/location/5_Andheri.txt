There should be service center in Western line area like Andheri
It should little bit near prabhadevi to till Andheri has no any service center them
There is no space in Andheri dealership showroom so they should increase the space.
Madhuban Toyota is at east side. It should be at western side. Khar is nearby if it comes to Andheri then it will be good because we can save our travelling time.
Mabhuban dealership location is too far. I stay at Jogeshwari from there I came to Kurla for servicing. If the service center is at before 2 stations then it will be fine. Like from Jogeshwari to Vile Parle or Andheri there should be service center nearby then it will be good in which we can go and check the car easily. All the things need to be update on phone itself.
