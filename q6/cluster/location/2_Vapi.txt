There is huge issue in location of dealership mentioned on Google map. I was trying to reach dealership with taking help of Google maps it was showing different location. On Google map location of dealership was at end of graveyard road but no single building was there on that road. It was dead end road. I was not so familiar with Vapi city so I called relation officer Mr. Parikh and I told him that direction of your dealership location is showing wrong on google map.
Saraswat center is too far. I had to go this much far and in Vapi they are not returning car. As soon, they are taking 2-3 days after servicing.
