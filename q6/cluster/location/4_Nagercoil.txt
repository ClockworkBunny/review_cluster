We live in Nagercoil & Kanniyakumari but the dealership is in Tirunelveli. I have to travel around 100 kms to reach dealership. If there will be a service centre in Nagercoil, then it is beneficial to us. They have showroom but no service centre.
I stay in Nagercoil but my dealership is ternavelli it is very far for me, They should be provide the service center in Nagercoil then it is better, Showroom is there in Nagercoil but dealership is not there.
I stayed at Nagercoil but Dealership at Tirunelveli, Hence I travelled at 75Km for Dealership .hence one dealership should be between at Nagercoil or Kenya Kumar then we will very happy. Other service is all good.
If the dealership is at Nagercoil then it will be good. We use to take separate time for service. In Nagercoil There is more showroom of other company so there should be one showroom of Toyota also.
