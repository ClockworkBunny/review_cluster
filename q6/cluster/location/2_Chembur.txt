Location issue is there. It is somewhat difficult to find out it. Should give pick up and drop facility to customers without charges so it will be easy for customers.  Should have enough space for car repairing.  It should be easily accessible and the dealer ship which is having in Chembur are it is different than other areas.
Dealership location were in front of premises so it should be development .Dealership had already problems but I don?t know what is that problem, The places problem are not. If the customer went away at dealership the way of roads is not proper their were kadaa.All the customers complaining about this. I am staying at Bhandup and went to service centre Chembur so I am satisfied. But I am not satisfied at the dealership location. So the dealership location should be good .
