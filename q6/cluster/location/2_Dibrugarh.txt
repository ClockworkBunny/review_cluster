It should be near or around the area. We are 90km far from Dibrugarh area. And the service is 10-13km from Dibrugarh. It takes one day and we can?t let the car go with the driver. A service center can be in Tinsukia.
Borah Toyota is located in Dibrugarh which is very far from my residence if it is in Sibsagar then it would be better.
