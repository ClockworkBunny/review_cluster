The locations are between two cities. Like it?s should more convenient if it is outside the Kasargod city then it will be much better.
Service center is 530 to 550 far away from my home. They should pick car from my home and deliver it at home within 7 days after the service. It should located in Kasargod city, place Chemanna otherwise in Uppala.
