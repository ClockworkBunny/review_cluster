Location should be improved, it should be between Kalyan and Dombivli. Millennium Kamlyan Toyota location is very far from me it should be in the city.
Location should be centralize. Transport facility should be available.  If we want to go by which train or which bus then extra car should be available for drop.  In Kalyan city they are having very nice location.  If I dropped my car to your place then I can  go by train as well.  same as if I want to go or Shilphata or thane then might be will face problem.  So it would be easy for customer.
