Dealership is far away. I live in Gandhi nagar and dealership is in Vaishali Nagar, so dealership should be nearby.
Service center is in Kadaloure city but there is a Toyota showroom in in Puducherry near Rajiv Gandhi statue. So it would be good if service center is available there.
Now your showroom in which area that are area is in near to Gandhi ham main center area which is little far. Other company?s dealerships are near by 2-3 kilometers only but your dealership is far. Now they cannot do anything for that but.
Our dealership is in Gandhi nagar. So it?s too far away Infinium Toyota is also in Ahmadabad & that is also only 2 so in taking appointment also it is taking long time. And the count of car is too much. I had to go 30km Ahmadabad we is long & they providing pick up & drop in Ahmadabad but not providing for outsiders. The rates of parts are very high. Yesterday only my car was in servicing as one cable was not working & the fill was of Rs.16, 000/-. They didn?t give any % discount. They should provide some % for regular customer in Infinium.
