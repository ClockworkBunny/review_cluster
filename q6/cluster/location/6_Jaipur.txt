It is a bypass area if it would be in national highway then there was no problem. It would be good if it would be available in Jaipur area.
In Koraput of Jaipur there is no service center. A service center is required here. I t would be good enough if the service point can be channelized here.
Dealership location is far. At Jaipur road were all the dealership are their Like Maruti it should be also there only.
Service center Location is very far from in city. When we are taken away our car at service center then we are taken with us one person and also we are taken back our cars then also we are taken with us one person. Their not get the Auto Rickshaw. Service center should be at Jaipur road. Jaipur Bypass service center far from us. Hence, should be Pick up and drop facility.
Dealership location is available almost 40 km from Jaipur. So I thought they should arrange showroom at nearby Jaipur city.
location far away from me. one more dealership should open. because I sty in Mansarovar. 30 to 35 Kilometer far away to me for went to Vikai service center from Mansarovar. that's why little far away to me this location. They should open one service center in middle of Jaipur then the all sides of customers will have visited this service center only. if any new service center they open then He must be open the service center 10 kilometers away from my house
