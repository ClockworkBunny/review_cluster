From  Kolhapur the service center is 10 to 14km away. So it should be nearby the Kolhapur.
They should have center in Rajarampuri in Kolhapur
It should be in city. Pune to Kolhapur there is no service center. So there should be one service center in Karad or nearby karad. Maximum customer stays there so it should be here.
Dealership location is far from me. There should be pickup and  drop facility for the customer. When we are taken away the car, then there should be dropping facility to the customer. Sambhapur is very far from the customer. Appointment we get 12 to 1.30 pm. Hence, it should be at between Kolhapur city
Location was out side. It should be on Sangli or Kolhapur road.
DSK Kolhapur location is 15-20 kms away from my village. I don?t say that they should be exactly in my village and I know that is not possible also so for this they must increase the pickup and drop service. It is already there but needs to be increased little more.
The service station is outside Kolhapur and is 10-15kms away from my place. Therefore there are lots of problem while going there. There should be a service center in Kolhapur  even if its 1km away, it would still be convenient for us. The one which I go to is on the Highway and is far away.
