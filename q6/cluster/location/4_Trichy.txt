Service center in Trichy is at bypass road instead it should be near town.
In Pudukkottai area service centers are less. So they should have a dealership in between Pudukkottai & Trichy area.
Dealership is only in Trichy If there would be dealership in Thanjavur highway. There are many companies hence one dealership can be there.
Lot of people using Toyota car at Karaikudi but there is only Toyota showroom. At Trichy there is a big dealership same like they must provide at karaikudi also.
