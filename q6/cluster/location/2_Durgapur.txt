Major accident service not done here, have to go 60-70 KM driving to Durgapur which hazardous. We wish to complete major servicing with all type of service here, except that all other service of Toyota is good, only to avoided to go Durgapur. Staff should increase, for that they are all busy to move here and there to solve many customer's problems, all men want advantages,
If the service centre is nearer to Durgapur city centre then it will be better.
