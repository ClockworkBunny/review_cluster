Nippon Toyota is almost 16 KM from my place. Dealership should be there near by my place i.e. Manelikra Kayamkulam.
Location is 1.5 hours far from our place. They have to organize one dealership in ne district. They should open more outlet in eastern part from where they can cover 2-3 district near border. I am in middle part of Kerla Nippon is locate in western area. They don?t have any branches in western 5 areas so they should open Nippon dealership in western area. It can locate in Rajirapalli area because most of people use Toyota here. I have noticed more than 100 Toyota vehicles here.
Nippon Toyota kalamassery is 20-25km far away from my location as it is well- flagged and well equipped and as kodgingilus is also place where they could locate by but I am not sure whether the service center is already there (20km), they could locate in parur (8km)
Nippon Toyota service center main gate road is very busy road customers were not easily entered in the location of service center & also in service center same as when customers were exit from the service center that time road is very unsafe for the customer.
Dealership location is very far for us, It should be near then it is good for us. In Nippon dealership Should be located at main area.
