I have to travel 100 KM far for service of my car so it should be near. I am staying at Palghar but I have to visit at Vashi or Vasai for servicing. If dealership will be available in Palghar or Bhoiser area it will save our diesel and driver charges. Even my friend having vehicles but they do service from local area but I go for brand so I visit till dealership. If dealership will be here then it will be good for everyone.
Location situated too far away from my home. I have to go 100 KM from my place. Many number of Innova and Fortuner cars at my place. If you open a service centre in Palghar it will be great for us. We go in Vasai for servicing if service centre open in Plaghar it will easy to go there.
Dealership location is situated in Vasai & Nalasopara high way, I was facing problem to travel there. For servicing there is more difficulty of pickup & drop. Their is no other source of travelling. Its location is very inconvenient to travel. My 2-3 hours was waste to travel there. If dealership location is situated in city area so it will easy to accessible for the customers. Customers need to travel the Nalasopara west or till Vasai highway because it is located in Vasai entrence.If we want to go there we have to change at least 3-4 auto rikshaw.There is no other source to travel there if we give our vehicle for servicing then there is no other vehicle to come back to our place we face the difficulty if we drop or pickup the vehicle from there. The location is easy to accessible for customers & dealership will located in city limits. Where the customers can easily travel & we also found the other vehicle easily. There is no difficulties for pickup & drop facility.
