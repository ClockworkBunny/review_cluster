If service center location is nearby then it will good. Current the location is far away. It should be nearby Nagar or Shirdi as well as it should be available within 20 to 25 km.
For the customer house the servicing center is far. From 20 to 25 km is far. Servicing center is in outer area. It should be in city like Gomathi Nagar or Banaras area.
We come from Marai malai Nagar it takes around 2 hours to reach .if it is located in the main area i.e. nearby Thambaram then will be good.
Which had Galaxy outlet which should have in dwarka but there is no service centre. If we open there service centre so we had less tribble.To go Mothi Nagar because in Mothi Nagar had Mayapuri traffic occurred.
I have visited to Saini Toyota howrah which was very far from my residence because my residence is Trebeny. in service centre is nearer to Chandan Nagar or Chunchura  then it would be better
