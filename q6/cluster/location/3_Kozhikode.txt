Dealership location should be improved. I brought the vehicle from Kozhikode dealership . New dealership should be made available Kohianady area.
There is new dealership branch at Kozhikode Jilla but till now it was not opened completely. Hence they need to concentrate and do not leave it simply and need more service centers like this and at Kozhikode Nadakkavu, Elathur and Palankadi in these palaces need dealerships branches.
Dealership location is not much good, we round up the whole city and reaches at end. It would be good to open a new dealership at Thamarashery Kozhikode medical college place.
