Location of Infinium is 60 kilometer far from Bhuj city. It will be good if any service station can arranged in Bhuj.
Infinium Gandhidham is far from Bhuj city so it increases our expense for traveling. It wastes our diesel. There should be service center in Bhuj because from bhuj service center is 75-80 kilometer far. 3-4 hours we have to sit there. It is very costly for us to do servicing. This should be improving at dealership.
Service station is very far from Bhuj & we visit at least twice in a month to service station so it should be near. We don?t think it will be improved. We face issue to travel because I live in Bhuj and the place from where I have purchased this car is 50-60 kilometer far so we have to visit there. They should give service in Bhuj twice in a month and it should be inform to us when they come for service in our city. Service station is very far from here so it is difficult to travel because we have to in working days. In my area at least 300-400 Toyota vehicle is there.
Dealership location is 200 km far away. There should be one service center at Bhuj mehsana.
