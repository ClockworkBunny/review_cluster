My house is in Tuticorin but service center is located in Tirunelveli to travel from my home to dealership it takes 2 hours of duration. If service center will be locate at Tuticorin then it will save lots of our time.
We are staying at Kanyakumari but dealership location is at Tirunelveli this is so far from Kanyakumari. If dealership have branch at Kanyakumari will be better.
We live in Kanyakumari but dealership is located in Tirunelveli which is 85 Km far. There is showroom here but no service center. There is mobile service even though for complete servicing need to go to Tirunelveli dealership
My village is Nagercoil there is no Toyota dealership, so for servicing I have to anaamalai Tirunelveli Dealership, if they should open one Toyota service centre in Nagercoil, so it?s good for us.
We are in Thutukudi, so every 12, 13 & 14 of the month three staff coming from Tirunelveli for mobile service, we are not getting this service properly. Maruti & Honda they have dealership in Thutukudi so if Toyota also have then it will be good.
I reside in Nagarkovil and I have to visit till Tirunelveli for servicing the car and it takes 1 and half hours. Need a service center at Nagarkovil.
I want dealership in Nagercoil; Tirunelveli dealership is for Honda, Nizan, Maruti company are there but Toyota dealership is not there the people in Kanyakumari are high settled they need Innova and for tuner but dealership is not there in that  place because of that they are not buying.
I stay at Nagercoil but Anaamalai dealership is at Tirunelveli I used to go there for servicing full day time west diesel waste for going over there if the is a dealership in Nagercoil is will be good.
I stay at Marthandam and I used to travel 200km to reach Anaamalai Tirunelveli dealership. It is time waste and diesel waste. So the dealership should be Nagercovil Toyota dealership then it will be good.
