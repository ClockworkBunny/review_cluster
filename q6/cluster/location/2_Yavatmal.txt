we have to go 150-200 km for servicing. Yavatmal district is very large. So they should have service center here.
Customers are coming to you from long distance like Bhandara Amravati so, you may have all the record and you know that which part the car sales more so you should open service center at that place. You don?t have showroom at Varadha and Yavatmal if there is service center nearby then people who come from Chandpur it will be suitable for them they will not face problem of traffic. I take car from Yavatmal but service center is not there. So I have to come 150 to 200 km to Nagpur. It is at Kamatee and we have to spent full day.
