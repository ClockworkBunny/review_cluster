Now, a days cost of cars increased , most of customer purchasing Innova Fortune. At Haldwani showroom only one in big commercial cities, hence sales and servicing at increased. I am servicing my car after two years. At least one more showrooms should be there. So all cities covered like Jodhpur, Kashipur and Ramnagar . All Customer not possible to went at Haldwani,it is in Conducted area and also not good at location. It should be opened at service center at Kashipur, Jodhpur and  Ramnager we are not required went at Haldwani.I don't want taken away my car at Hadwani service centere, but I forced to went away. Most of time I am servicing my car at private service centre. If I went at Muradabad but  at road is not proper hence we will taken 45 minutes, but their only properly servicing our car.Kashipur is big city hence in future should be opened at one service centre.
If location is nearby then it will good. It is almost 90 km from my location It should in Jodhpur nearby 50 km so it will better.
