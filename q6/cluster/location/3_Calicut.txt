It should be good to near to Calicut town. Accessories department is not there staying in the cauromer areas. The place of the product which  to high. the same product I get  from out side the of get Amara Toyota space. i both from of out side. if it is 100, I buy from out side It will be 500 only.
Amana dealership Calicut is 40 Km. far away and Apollo dealership which is started newly it is 3 km. far away.  Amana dealership are not providing water services but Apollo dealership provide water services and extra services also.
Dealership should improve their location Calicut 55km away for me. So they should made available a new dealership at Pudhiya Angaadi.
