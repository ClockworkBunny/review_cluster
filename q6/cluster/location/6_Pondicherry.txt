Location of the dealership is in Pondicherry so it should be in Town area.
Dealership is far away from Pondicherry and located near kadalur have to travel around 15 Km it reach dealership and its very difficult to whiling returning. So if the dealership is located in Pondicherry or else in outer area of Pondicherry will be more beneficial for us.
At dealership location is very far from me. We are travel 15 kms, at the dealership centre. One more dealership should be at Pondicherry town or Pondicherry outer it should be there.
Lanson Kancheepuram dealership is located very far. At Pondicherry Rajivghandi square place there is showroom and it would be good if they make a dealership there or nearby. Replacing a small part in the car we have to visit Dealership instead it will be good if they provide service of the same in showroom.
All the Toyota motors showroom are located in city main areas but Lanson Pondicherry Dealership is located in outer area. Other companies like Mahindra, Maruti and TATA have located their dealership next to their showroom. As comparing to them Toyota dealership and showroom has long distance. It would be good if the place both Dealership and Showroom in the same place.
Lanson Pondicherry Dealership is located far from my place 15 KM. It would be good if they can locate it in main place.
