Place from where we purchased the car there is no service center near to it. It would be good if it is in the center of Lucknow
Location having in a long distance. We has to go 50 Kilometer far for servicing. In city should be open the Toyota service center. In Lucknow has service center but has so far for go there it take full one day. They should be open the service center in Peraij. So we cannot go so far if they open the service center in a city then Toyota customers are also increase.
In Faizbabad there is only Toyota agency. The Toyota service center is 200kms away from Faizabad and 80kms away from my house. I have to come all the way to Lucknow for servicing. The service center in Lucknow is always crowded and the travelling cost sums upto 2000Rs. Their service center should be within 100kms.
Location is far away it should be nearly Lucknow it is capital of UP Durance have lets of showroom of Maruti it Toyota open one showroom over here then it will be good. We have to go 20km long if it open here then we have to go only 2 km you should tell all things to them. They should increase dealership.
