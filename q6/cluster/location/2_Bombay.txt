Service center should be at south Bombay Location of service center need to be at Colaba Churchgate or Nariman point. Your dealership at Nariman point is Shinrai Toyota but that center is found & so I don?t take my car from Shinrai . I purchase vehicle from Mathuman. That?s why your dealership needs to be at south Bombay.
They should open one showroom on highway it will be convenient for us. They should start one service center on Bombay banglor highway.
