The location of the dealership should be situated in town of shilling. Highland Shillong Dealership is outside of Shillong.
The dealership location should have been nearer to the city, it is little far. Always traffic jam is there. Coming and going is a problem. I think this is difficult for them because there is hurriness in place nearer cities, that is may be the constraint for them. They can search for a place for a service center nearer Shillong city.
