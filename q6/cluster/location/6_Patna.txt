your service center is faraway is should be in city. Service center should be in Patna it is far away 25/30km.
Location is little far it is on outskirts. It becomes too far for us. It needs to be closer. It is on by pass. It should be near by to Gandhi city in Patna
If location of dealership is situated in end of the Patna or west side of the Patna it will be better for us. They should not take any Tax. It should be Tax free.
There is very good experience of Jaipur and Patna service center but Alvar service center is far away. There is lot of dust to rich over there car full of dust need updating over there infrastructure should improve.
I stays at Chatapur Bihar, there is no service center available over here I have to 70 KM for service center. Company should think about customer convenience. There is service center at Patna which is 70 KM & one at Muzafferpur Rudra Toyota. They place 2 showrooms in one area. In Madakpura, shifon, Ardiya, Kisangaon kariyar, Bursela there is not any center available of Toyota. Buddha Toyota comes to give service but they don?t have mechanic. So customer suffers a lot. They not get proper service. If you can request then you told them purniya is big mechanical center. All company service center is over there like Maruti, fort, tata Mahindra cheberlet so thing about that all brand service center is their exact Toyota so open one service center over there. It should be good for near by district customer.
Dealership should be have in Patna because it was far away to us. While purchased a car they told me inside a Patna near by of saguna road one more showroom will be open but till now it was not happen
