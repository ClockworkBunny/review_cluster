I am facing problem at dealership location Udaipur were I stay. For that I used to go Ratlam. But it is not nearby. The Rajpalk service center is convenient as compared to Udaipur service center. 2-4 months I am facing a problem. The staff won't come on time. their is some internal problem so that I suppose to go Ratlam dealership.
The first thing there is no location of Toyota. The regular service which is done is of no use. I am telling you that any of the workshops of any vehicle, like 2 wheeler, 3 wheeler or 4 wheeler the work is done properly there. Think like you had taken a car of Maruti, so in workshop of maruti only maruti cars are standing there so the workshop of Toyota should also be in proper area. We had purchased the car from Aravali & it is 650 km distance of Aravali from our place. We are having Udaipur nearby so a workshop of Toyota should be open in Udaipur. A good dealership location.
