Jay Ganesh Toyota center there is no much service to provide use. At Gungarh area their should be one services center. Their are so many cars for going to the services center we have to use 100km petrol to go their. We go to Rajkot for big servicing.
Infinium Rajkot service center was 90km far. If the service center is in morbi because the customer are more of Inn ova and For tuner
At Infinium Toyota only distance should be little reduce. Their charges are reasonable they don?t even charge much from us but service center is little far that is only issue we have. If it will be near to Rajkot city, then it will be better. Construction wise location is good but distance is far from the Rajkot city.
