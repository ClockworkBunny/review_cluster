Dealership location should be available in APMC Pune nearby 30 KM.
location should be by  km or at Pune Bangalore highway or by Hinjewadi.
Service center should available within 5 km. In overall Pune city there is available only one dealer. It will be easy if one more dealer available.
Sharayu location should be in Pune Bhosari or otherwise it should be 2 to 3km distance.
We do work in routing servicing Dsk. Sharayu is so far for us. We stay in Kotharud. Sharayu center is opposite to use. It should be in Pune south or west.
Dealership Pune service center is 100 KM far away from my home. So it should be at least 40-45 KM. there should be showroom at village also District & city have service center but farmers also buy Toyota car. So at Shiroor, Junner, Baramati, Indapur they should open as I think.
Service center should be nearby 10 - 15 KMS from Pune
location should be in Pune or nearby city. Current location is 25 km away which should be within 10-15 km as it would be better for us. Dealership would get good business from this
We stays at village. So if location will be at out side of Pune means at Vagholi then it will be good for us. We face problem of road means we have to face lots of taffic. Innova & Fortuner more at village. So if it is nearby Vagholi then good for us.
