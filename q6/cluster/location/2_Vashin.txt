I have to travel 100 KMS to visit service center. If there is a service center monthly camp should be available. There are more vehicle in Vashin so there should be a service center.
Grace Akola service center is far from village almost 80 km from our place. I live in Vashin so it is difficult to go 80Km far for servicing there should be a service center available in Vashin.
