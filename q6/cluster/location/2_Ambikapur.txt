Service center is far away. There should open one service center at Ambikapur district Koria.
I stay at Vilaspur it is 250km far away from service center. So we not think to visit there much. They built TD Toyota camps. So we visit there for servicing location is far away so I am dissatisfied. They should open service center at Ambikapur camp servicing is not sufficient compare to service center machines are not available here. So my suggestion is they should service center at Ambikapur. We have spend 1500 to reach Vilaspur & for servicing again 1500/-. So the expenses are more up to Rs.3000/-TD Toyota should open service center with one office one person is here of sales at Ambikapur.
