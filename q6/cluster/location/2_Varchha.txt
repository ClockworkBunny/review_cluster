We are staying in Varchha area but there is not service center I this area. Varchha is very big area still there is not service center available in this area. We have to take our car for servicing to Hajirta or Adajan area which is far for us and we have to face some issues while returning back to home if we have to put car at the dealership we have to travel by auto. We think that Toyota should organize new dealership in Varchha road or in Varchha area.
Dealership location is little far for me. Dealership is in Ajira area and I am living in Varchha village. Dealership is 30 KM far from my place so it will be better if dealership will be only 10 KM far. Dealership is far for me.
