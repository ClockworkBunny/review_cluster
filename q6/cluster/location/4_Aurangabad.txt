Service center should be according to the disk Aurangabad or sasaram should be in between this one service center
Sharayu Aurangabad service center needs to be in city. It is 13-14 Km far from my house. But all the other company service center are inside the city but this one is too far.
Sharayu Aurangabad service center needs to be inside the city. In that location the car comes for service is huge. I need to travel 12 km far from my house. The location needs to be inside the city itself. They should provide pick up & drop facility to customer.
They need open service center in Aurangabad Cidko MIDC area. Sharayu Toyota is a one of the best Toyota. It is very necessary in MIDC Aurangabad  because its to far for city person to go out of the city just for the servicing of the vehicle.
