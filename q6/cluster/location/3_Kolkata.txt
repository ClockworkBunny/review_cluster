The location of dealership need to improve. If a service center will be open in kharagpur then it would be better. So many peoples of here are interested to but car but due to the distance of service center they steps back.  If a service center will be open near kharagpurpur then not only the peoples of Kolkata others peoples of different region will be able to buy car. If dealership will not open but at least if a service center will be open here, then the sales of Toyota will be increases.  Due to the distance of service center peoples can't buy car.
There must be a glow sign board or a big sign board so that the people who are coming from Kolkata can understand how u goes for Saini Toyota. Those people who are coming from Kolaghat, they can know now this is take turn and now you go this way, so you can go to Saini Toyota. From where you can take turn, from there if a road sign will give or arrange something so that we can know from here we can go to Saini Toyota.
No service center available in North Kolkata, if Toyota has open a service center at North Kolkata so it is good for us.
