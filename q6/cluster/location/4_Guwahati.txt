The dealership located at Bypass and it very far from town, for that felt hazard from communications, if it near Guwahati near town it will be more better.
Guwahati dealership is too far from my residents, if Toyota arranged a dealership in Dibrugarh then it well be good for us.
In Assam if service center will be located in Tejpur then it would be better for us because Gargya Guwahati service center is 150 km far
If dealership location will be nearer inside the city like Guwahati then it would be better. They provide 3 services but 1 service they provide by coming come.
