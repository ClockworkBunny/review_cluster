There are service center in Raipur,Bilayat and Bilaspur.In Whole area of Chhattisgarh service center of Raipur is been closed from last 4 months. We do not get parts in bilayat. The should be an 2 dealership available in Raipur.
Location is very far from the city. It would have been better had it been in the city. It is too far from the city.  Even if I myself go there in the evening to leave the car then while coming back you do not get any bus or any other vehicle from there and there is no auto also. They must open one dealership in Raipur and close this one
Dealership Location should be at Raipur Chhattisgarh is big capital there is also not any dealership over there.
Location is far away it is 40 Km far away from Raipur .It is should be at Raipur at 5 Km distance so we did boot face problems.
