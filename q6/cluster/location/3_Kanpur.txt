From Kanpur its far away because of that face problem. It should be near by. If it would be good if it will be available inside the Kanpur city. Place should be like that where service center should be in 30 minute. From our place service center should be 4to 5 km.
They should be open the service center in the Kanpur City.
Sometimes the location is nor proper. Kanpur is very big city and there is only one dealership. There should be at least 2. One should be in the middle of the city. We are unable to take a claim many times because of dealership is so far. If they have 2 showrooms then that would reduce the burden also, and time deduction would also happen
