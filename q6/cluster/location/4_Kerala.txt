In near my house Toyota is having Dealership center they do dealing and sales of cars in Kerala but they do not do servicing of cars. If they start giving services for Toyota customers it will be much better.
New service center should be open. In between Kanjrallipali & Earuttubita.In Kerala one service center is their. One dealership should be their in Idukki.
Dealership location is 15-20 km far away from my home. I book from Chalakkudi which is 7 km away but there is no option for servicing. There should be option for servicing. I get delivery from Irinjalakuda at Kerala Trishul district.
There is no dealership in Kerala any where this should be one service center in that place then it will be good.
