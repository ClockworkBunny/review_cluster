location is for away there is problem of location of centers in Mumbai I can understand but the distance should be that much for so that we cannot reach out there road is very small to reach there & after reaching there is no transport available to come back Shinrai Toyota Vanali location was very good.
Dealership location is far away. It should be at Mumbai western line.
The service center should be open at out of Mumbai. For me it 100Km far to go for servicing my car. Because of that the service center should be out of Mumbai
