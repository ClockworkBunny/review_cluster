Towards dealership location: If it will be in Bhubaneswar then it would be good.  The dealership is about 17km away from my home and this 17 km taking around 45 minute to 1 hr.  So I am bit inconvenience for the location.
It is far away from me. It should be at Bhubaneswar in my district.
If the service centre is located in Bhubaneswar at  khandagiri patia area then it would be better
The location of servicing is very far from my house. They don?t provide any facility there. If there was a service center at Bhubaneswar in NH side area like Burmunda and Rasungar then it will be better.
