Dealership location at 45 km & in between there is no other dealer. It should available at Malappuram district. Because the Amana is 25km away from the malapuram. So it should be available in middle of the Malappuram bias-pass or main road. Both are convenient. It should be available in proper Malappuram.
Dealership location is not more convenient from my home 2 dealership are there but both are more than 25 kilometer far. Location must be improving it should be in kondatti or Malappuram. Malappuram showroom is 17 kilometer away from city.  Exact to Airport.
They should improve in dealership location as in Manjeeri or Nilambur now it is located in Nirander Malappuram
They should on location. It takes 40 Km to go Malappuram dealership. In throughput there is Nippon dealership for that it is 5 Km far. There should be location within 10 Km nearby then it will be good.
