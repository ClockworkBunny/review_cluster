There should be service center located in Jam nagar. So that we would not have to travel to Porbandar. Dwarka is near by. Ahmedabad & Rajkot it is there. If showroom would be open in Jam nagar & Porbandar then it would be good. Now a days Toyota company has there service center every were.
Location need to improve little. Location is 10-12 KM far from our place. There are 2 location of dealership in Ahmedabad city which both are far from our place. May be Toyota don?t give dealership in city area. We have popper highway area in Maninagar & Narooli. They can open dealership here.
