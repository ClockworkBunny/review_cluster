If anyone visits from far away like 100/150km so they should attend them first. Because the location of dealership is far away . Topline Toyota is far away and Rajendra Toyota is near. We have purchase car from Topline and we have to travel 300km and Buddha Toyota is 110 km far away same Rajendra Toyota is 130 km far away. Topline should be in Bihar because it is situated in Jharkhand. It should be in highway and its locate near by Doha Darghati. Shakharam service center should be remain open.
From my residence the distance of dealership was 250km. For servicing I spend my whole day there. Sometimes I have to wait for the whole night. If there was a service center in Bihar at Araria then it?ll be better.
