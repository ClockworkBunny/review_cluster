They must start one more service center in some other area like in  MIDC areas etc. There all other service centers are available like Audi , Mercedes etc. only this is in Kamothe area for which we have to travel 25 kms far. If its on 5-7 kms distance then it is fine.
Location is far away. It took lots of time. It is in Value MIDC. So there should be one bypass or it should main road on the way or it should available in MIDC area so at least will get car with servicing.  It should be available 4 - 5 KM.
Location should be near about Vashi area. It is in MIDC area so it?s far. Location should be on main Sion-Panvel highway.
The location should be near by there should be other service center like grace Toyota, there should be a service center in kamti road, Ghotkar kai and also in MIDC wadi.
Ahmednagar dealership location is opposite side of the district we have to cross farm to reach. It should be nearby to MIDC to returning home there is no vehicle facility auto is very expensive.
Location is out of city, it should be in city. The showroom is our side and we purchased the car once but we have to go there most often for servicing.  Chikhalthana and MIDC area is having such type of transportations as pick up and drop facility is having there. We want to say about servicing but how can we say as we have to go there.
There is only one service center and there should be one more service center. MIDC and Hinge like that place there should be a service center.
