They should have canteen in their Madurai & kampaloor service centers.
I live in Kovilpatti but the dealership are in Tirunelveli, Madurai and Virudhunagar. All  these location are very far. Must open at least one service centre in Kovilpatti.
The dealership location is in Madurai but we are staying in Theni Podi, it was so far from our residence. We have to travel every time to Madurai. If it is nearby Theni then it will be good?
Dealership is in Tirunelveli, Madurai after that in Trichy. Service must be there in remote areas might be near Ramnadu. They take signature in feedback form along with bills. Asked them why did like these they say sorry.
I reside at Dindigul and for servicing I have come Madurai after travelling 80 KM distance. Thus my whole day is wasted on this. After a long time even there is no Hotel facility, hence we feel bad about this.
