We have to travel 300 KM to reach location of dealership. Dealership should be available at Jamnagar city so it will only 100 KM far from my village.
Dealership location is very for away if it is in Jamnagar or Rajkot city so it will good for me.
Infinium Rajkot location was far away. We stay in Jamnagar to their it had on 150 km it should be near like till 40-50 km, so it will good for us.
Jamnagar Mahanagarpalica is a big city. We have many big industries in our city like Reliance, SR, IOS, Hindustan so it is our only requirement. Not a dealership but at least we need a sub dealership here in Jamnagar. If you now check in Jamnagar, you will find many Toyota customers here in city and everyone has only one dealership for service at Rajkot. They should at least introduce a sub dealership by understanding our requirements. I have told this to company as well it will benefit us in the distance of 95 KM for each service. You can open a dealership in Jamnagar but if in Jamnagar it is not possible then they should open a dealership at Rajkot-Jamnagar highway. As Maruti have already having 3-3 workshop & showroom on that road. If you open your service station at Rajkot-Jamnagar highway near Pendha then we have to go by ring road side and on that road have much traffic which takes more than 1-2 hours of time to cross that road. 2 hours in the morning & 2 hours in the evening it takes to reach service. If we want to go from showroom we have to take delivery of car from showroom on correct time because after 6 traffic is very high on that road this is the reason I am saying a substation is required in Rajkot-Jamnagar highway. At Jamnagar hey have many customers of Toyota for them they need to think. Only Toyota?s workshop is not available at Jamnagar other all workshops are there in our city. Nexa Maruti also open a new dealership here.
