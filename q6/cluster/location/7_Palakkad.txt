Dealership location should locate near to Palakkad place.
Because there now only one dealership center in Palakkad Which so far from my residence If you arrange one more dealership in Palakkad and Vattapalav it is help for the customers.
The dealership is very far from the place where we live. Dealership in Palakkad area should be in the distance of 5 km.
From my place if have to go service center then we have to drive 50 km it is far away. In the Palakkad only one service center is available. So they should arrange the service center at Sonnur, Pattambhi, Perunthurmanna so it will be comfortable to us.
If Dealership location is in Palakkad then it will be good of us.
If dealership location is at Palakkad town then it will be good.
Dealership location is too for. It should be opened near Palakkad also.
