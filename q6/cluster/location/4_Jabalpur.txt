Location is outside area. It should be in Jabalpur area.
Location are far it should have in Jabalpur service center is far to the Jabalpur and outside of Jabalpur has no any arrangement of food it's also so far which they provide tea and water in service center inside the Jabalpur like almost 10-5 km inside.
Dealership location should be improve. Dealership is far away from Jabalpur city it should be nearby then it will be good for us. Dealership should be nearby to city.
There should be an indication of the dealership on the main-main roads. I stay 250kms away from Jabalpur. Jabalpur is municipal city and the dealership point of Commercial Toyota is in Tilwara. In Amarkantan-Jabalpur road, there should be proper indications as to where the right and left turns are to be taken. This would help people find their way to the dealership point. This should be done all over India. The local people would know how to go to Commercial Toyota but people who come from outside wouldn't understand roadside. Or the Toyota should launch a mobile app for the customers which connects through the mobile GPS system. The Dealership location shouldn't be in the out area. Every company's dealership should be located in the same area itself. E.g.: In Chhattisgarh Vilaspur city,all dealerships are located in one area. This system isn't available in the other cities. In mobile apps,there should be proiper indications or sign boards for the dealerships.
