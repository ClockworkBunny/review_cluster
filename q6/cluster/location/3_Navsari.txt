I have mailed feedback about all this about service station and washing but there is no impact of that from last 2 years? company people saying that we will start service station here as well but they didn?t do anything so we are dissatisfied.  If we have service station here, then everything will be solved. Service should be available at 24 hours and Navsari area have many Toyota vehicles. They don?t have parts too customer have to visit Vapi for parts and more 150 kilometers we have to travel.
Rathore Vapi is very far to us. We stay at Navsari & it is 60km far. Navsari Toyota there is only showroom & workshop is not there so it should be there.
In Navsari should be have location for work shop for emergency work in Navsari have any workshop so there should also open a workshop Honda or Suzuki workshop had in Navsari but there had no any Toyota workshop for Compton so Toyota should open a worship indifferent different location in Navsari.
