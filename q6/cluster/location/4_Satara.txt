Location is far away from Satara it is 20 KM away. It should be available in Satara.
Location is not available in Satara city. We are facing lots of issues while returning back because it is on Satara Highway.  City is very far from Highway.  After brought the vehicle for servicing 3-4 hours we are spending over there.  In that time period they should done some facility for customer to return back as city is almost 6-7 KM far from that place and the Auto charged Rs. 150.
DSK Satara location is outside it is 70 km far away. City is 10 km far away from service center. If I want to visit dealership then I have to arrange another car and I have to tell my friend to drop me there. I have to spend 1-2 hours by watching TV, newspaper at service center.
It should be inside of Satara city. Other dealerships are near by city like Hyundai, Maruti  due to this our time is saving.
