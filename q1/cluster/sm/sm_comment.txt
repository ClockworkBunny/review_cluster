or they should arrange service like we can do booking through messages .
i need sms alert or any time of alert before one month for service appointment , because i stay far from the service station so i need to arrange some vehicle for servicing or i need to call my friends or relatives to pick up drop .
when i fix the servicing so no message comes your appointment done or not and when i go service center then they told we your appointment was not there .
when i call in the center then they told me your appointment was fix that why message should become .
if any problem arises in dealership number they should inform the customer through sms for the appointment purpose .
