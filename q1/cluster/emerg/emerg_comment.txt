one time i have an emergency , when i call them for appointment for pick up and drop but they not done .
i have an emergency but had to go there personally .
for emergency also we have to take appointment it consume time .
even for any emergency also .
we have some other alternative numbers for emergence appointment then it will be good
even if we re emergency they do not give appointment .
not on other time but at least on emergency they need to serve the customer accordingly .
if a person is in an emergency , the service center people should cooperate with the customers .
