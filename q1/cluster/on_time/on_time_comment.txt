whenever customer need to get service they should do servicing it that time frame .
if we want to take our vehicle out of city at that time they should do servicing of our car .
if we take appointment then they tell us to visit by 10 11 or if we visit on time they do not able provide service on time .
if they are providing a time period then they should fulfill on given time .
when customer comes in dealership that time they should quickly attend the customer give to proper response .
it would be good if they receive the car on time it means when we are taken number for appointment on the same number they should receive the car .
service must be done on time
they should have fullest service they should give appointment on time also
i have one problem that we are not getting appointment on time and if there is any festival that we are facing some problem .
when we taken the appointment that time car service must be done .
so they should give appointment to customer on time .
if we visit there on appointment taken time then also they are not take car on time .
while appointment which time they given for servicing , work should be done on that time and also they should not take another car for servicing which car came first for servicing they should prefer them first .
i never went to service center by taking an appointment because whenever i went there they do the servicing at that time because that time the cars are not present there which have taken time for the servicing .
when car gone there for servicing that time service advisor should come because he was came late .
there not giving appointment on time .
