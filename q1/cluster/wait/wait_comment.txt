after taking appointment then also i have to wait 1 to 1 and half hour .
after take appointment dealership staff should be servicing the car that time because customer take appointment but staff are not servicing car that time we have to wait for unnecessary 25minutes so that should be improved and they should have followed the appointment time properly .
there are 1 dealership only they should open more because we have to wait around 4 5 days .
they must not make us wait for 1 1 hour .
due to that waiting time is more .
whenever i go for service i have to wait outside of dealership till 30 minuets .
we have to wait on compound and even they don \?
we have to wait half hour to one hour .
if i go to bangalore or coimbatore we will give in 2 days but here i have to wait for 1 or 1 and half week
i reached there on their buffer time so then they tell me your car is in waiting .
they made me wait for 8 hours .
at last service i am waited too much time , should be improved appointment .
if there less car for servicing we are not waited long time .
hence i had waited more time .
once the appointment is confirm customer can delayed but if the customer is there in time that customer should be not keep waiting .
i am wait till 2 month to get service appointment they should thing customer was wait till month so they should give the appointment early
we have to wait for 1 month this is very long time .
we have to wait for long time .
we used to wait for 1 month for appointment or 25 days we used to wait .
even after 2 days also they say us to wait .
for appointment we need to wait for one to one half house .
management should take the responsibility on appointment the waiting space needs to be wide .
if customer gone there without any appointment so they should handle a customers as soon as possible and also customers should not wait so much it me
we taken appointment then also we had to wait there almost 4 5 hour so they should do that work within half hour .
because they told to wait for 1 month , so that we have to visit sharayu for servicing .
waiting time is more parts are available of car .
