also toyota has given only one number for all services .
i reached to the city where their is showroom they said service will not happen so they again provide one more number .
i said them the number which you provide me provide to all so we will not face any difficulties to search .
it would be good if they receive the car on time it means when we are taken number for appointment on the same number they should receive the car .
but the customer care people are very adamant that they cannot give the number .
it 's understandable that you ca n't give number but you should compromise and help the customer out with his request .
