jd is currently opened and location also we do not know .
to collect the car i have to come 15 km from home so they should open in jaipur also one more service center .
it would be convenient for customers like me if the service center is in the local area , as it will save the time as well as the crowd will be less .
as of now we need to travel 20 km to reach the service center .
the dealership location is traffic place they have to the space of the dealership location parking place provide should be available .
location is convenient place and charges are normal .
that is one of the area amana toyota should improve .
you people know the address of customer in which area which customer is there on that you can send the advice and it is near by from there .
it is 60 km away from my town and i had to go specially for servicing .
i got my appointment on 2nd but my car runned for 8000 km .
