Toyota is a very big company. They should provide 4 drivers to pick & drop the cars because the location of the dealership is too far. I have 2 car & one is Swift & they only come to pick the car for servicing & also drop it after servicing. So Toyota should also provide this provision for their customers. After servicing they call their customers & tell that servicing is completed & you can pick the car. Only after arguing with them they come to pick the car.

Workshop do not happen on the location of civil lines. It?s a heavy traffic area. It?s very difficult to take your car and its very far also.
I personally think that, they should open service center in Gandhinagar because Ahmedabad is very far for us. If we have any minor problem after service. We have to waste whole day for servicing. If service center will be in Gandhinagar we can give our vehicle to service center and go to our work. Service center is in Ahmedabad, so it?s not possible for us to go to dealership on working days.

When we drop the car for servicing they tell us the time for delivery but they do not give it on time. This is the improvement needed.
There is huge issue in location of dealership mentioned on Google map. I was trying to reach dealership with taking help of Google maps it was showing different location. On Google map location of dealership was at end of graveyard road but no single building was there on that road. It was dead end road. I was not so familiar with Vapi city so I called relation officer Mr. Parikh and I told him that direction of your dealership location is showing wrong on google map. 
They should improve on the location part. They had told that service center will come to Ramnade city but still it has not come. It is 100 km from Rameshwaram & 30 km. So it would be good if it is some where around 30 km from Ramnathpuram.
Location is very far from the city. It would have been better had it been in the city. It is too far from the city.  Even if I myself go there in the evening to leave the car then while coming back you do not get any bus or any other vehicle from there and there is no auto also. They must open one dealership in Raipur and close this one
There is no vehicle facility for visiting service center. So have to wait till servicing gets over. If location is nearby city then it would be good because servicing takes one full day. If location is nearby then we can wind up some other works as well.

It should somewhere close to the city. It is only one in Grand Dehradun. They should be few more. On Sharapur-Rajpur road, near S zone there should be a service center. It cannot be on any other place.
They should shift service center from there or should repair the road going to service center as the road have so many holes.

If they shifted the show room from G.T. Road and situated in locality then it would be better. G.T. Road  was under construction so I have to face problem  in the service center for In and Out time.

From the  time it was under construction it was not safe.

Chauhan Dhule service center is exactly near toll naka. Service center is near by walking distance from toll naka but to go we need to pay Rs. 300/- as tolnaka charges. So my advisable is the Toyota service should not be near the tolnaka & it should be inside the city itself.
Dealership should be open in Chattarpur. So, it will good for us many people want to purchased the car but service center not there. We have to go far away for servicing that's why they not purchased the car. So, it will have in chattarpur. It is good for us.
For small  work I used to travel for 5 km. one to one an half km inside location used to be there the service centre.
When the car is left for servicing at that time the difficulties that we face must be changed. Some where they should open the service station where all facilities are available. They must keep pickup and drop. I have Maruti car when we go there they give us alternate car for use. They say 2 days? time is required. This is our showroom car. We have swift, swift desire, alto they arrange for their person to drop. From this you understand that how much they care for us. They take responsibility to drop us at home. Your showroom does not have anything as such. Service department must be changed. Sharayu Bavdan are all on highway side. They should be in the city. Plant must have all the facilities like of Mahindra. They must perform like that.

But sometimes if they are busy and cannot take the car out so they must increase the space

When we came service that time dealership needs to arrange some facility to drop us to the city, because it was in outer & there is no proper transport facility. At least they have to arrange for everyone how transport to city. Even we need a transport while coming for delivery to pick up a car. There is no hotel for lunch.

When we leave the car outside at summer time in dealership its they?re outside only, They should be kept inside the dealership.
Sunny Toyota is very far from the city?s location. Their location should be in such a place that there any person or customer can reach easily.

Nanavati ajeera Surat dealership was far away. We had to go 25 km far. Varasa which have in Surat their only have Toyota dealership. So, their should also have service center. It good for us and also we or village people get profit in it. In Varasa service center had lots of crowd Nanavati dealership had 10-15 km far away. So nearby from it 4-5 km should be also having service center, so it will good. Which we done a servicing an outside and in service center also had lots of difference between it. Someone lived far so they done a servicing an outside which servicing was not so good. Nanavati Toyota also provides good service then also they should open service center.
I stay at vita but service center location should be at Karad or Sangli it is fine as per my wish.
From our place to dealership it takes 90 km to reach over there it takes 2 hours. On the way Lanson dealership was there but we didn?t get much satisfaction. So 1 hour or within 40 km if the dealership is available it will be good. From Vadalur there is no bus stop is available. Only the bus coming from Chennai will come through the place some bus driver will stop some will not stop in the place. Some time we use to go Kumbakonam from there we have to take a auto. So for this take full 1 full day to get a service.
Dealership area should be increased because it is very small in area. They take much time for servicing they should do the servicing quickly.
They should maintain the shades of Dealership.
First their service center had in Warli but not it was changed now it was had in ray road. Because of this we faced lots of problem it was not convenient location for us. Because we have to waste full day for a car servicing. We had to have taxi for of there it had in outside of a city them service center should be have in city because many people stay in south side which used them car.

Lanson dealership is located in outer so if it is in a main city it will be good.
Dealership locations is very long to belgum city & in this dealership not have drinking water & snacks & if we give the servicing for car in morning whole day we have to spend in dealership because dealership location is long in my area.
There is lot of traffic on roads hence it is problematic to go to dealership center.
Service center is in the city, it should be outside the city.
Location is far from the village. They should open another service centre as this is very much far from village. When going to Hazira from Surat we have to cross whole Surat city that is very far from city almost 120 kilometre so for servicing of 20000 kilometre I have to travel long and they don?t have any other service centre. 
Location is far away and there is not Restaurant nearby. So if we have to wait for 5 hours and we need some food or snacks, there is no arrangement for that as there is no Restaurant nearby. 
They should add one more dealership in that location.
We have to travel near about 150 KM to reach a service center in Nagpur. So there should a service center in Bardi or near to Bardi and it will we very useful to all.
Lanson Kancheepuram dealership is located very far. At Pondicherry Rajivghandi square place there is showroom and it would be good if they make a dealership there or nearby. Replacing a small part in the car we have to visit Dealership instead it will be good if they provide service of the same in showroom. 
Dealership location should be on highway and near by city.
Dealership location is 70 kilometers far for me. Just for servicing I have to travel 150 kilometers. It will be good if a service center will be open in district level because many Innova customers are there in Mehsana.

Dealership location is far away and the roads of the dealership are in the bad condition which makes inconvenient, They should have sperate space for the service center.

Location is very much far from my house.
Dealership location should near by Nalagarh.
Location situated too far away from my home. I have to go 100 KM from my place. Many number of Innova and Fortuner cars at my place. If you open a service centre in Palghar it will be great for us. We go in Vasai for servicing if service centre open in Plaghar it will easy to go there.
Service center should near by city.
I don't know
Dealership should be on main road and should have parking space.
Service center location should be nearby city.
The location of the service center is very far away from my house. They should open a service center in Bokaro Green City. There are Maruti and Hyundai service centers in Bokaro and they should open their service center too. 
Location is out of city, Most of the vehicles are from City and also there is traffic issue. So it should be available in City. 17 to 18 KM is manageable but it should be in main city not out of city. Location is not convenient.
They should open a dealership in Pathankot also.
Service center should be nearby 10 - 15 KMS from Pune 
The people from the service centre come only twice a week for servicing in Bardoli and that too they only check oil-water. It?d be better if they come 4 times a week because dealership location is 60kms  away and sums up to 120kms for the entire journey. 
The dealership location is 25kms far from my house. There should be a pick and drop service facility.
The Dealership location is 120kms away from my house. It would be better if the Dealership location is near
Dealership is little far from our place. Nanavati Toyota should open dealership at Patia textile market area or at Vadodara city side because current location is too far. 
I have to travel 160 KM to reach the dealership from my house. For an emergency as well I have to travel so long. It would be good if they located dealership at least in 50 KM long.
There are lot of vehicle of Toyota in Faizabad dealership location that we have to arrive at Lucknow. The arrange a camp but all the facility are not available. In Faizabad their should be an one more service center.  
If the dealership area will be larger than it would be good.
Nearby our locality
All the Toyota motors showroom are located in city main areas but Lanson Pondicherry Dealership is located in outer area. Other companies like Mahindra, Maruti and TATA have located their dealership next to their showroom. As comparing to them Toyota dealership and showroom has long distance. It would be good if the place both Dealership and Showroom in the same place.
Dealership is location is too long approx. 100 KM. It would be good if they located in some nearby area.
If the dealership will be located in Sreerampur then it will be good for the local people
Annamalai Coimbatore dealership is located in North side. Hence to reach there easily they can relocate it in highway main area
From my house to dealership, I have to travel till 20 KM and if they locate it in outer area of Singanallur then it would be really feasible for us. 
Anaamalai dealership is located in outer area and we do not get Auto, Canteen, Buses etc. This is very difficult to customers & pick up & drop service is also not available. Other dealerships give pick up & drop services. These things should be improved.
If Infinium Toyota will come little far then it will be better for us. Now current location is little fa. Gandhinagar is Capital of Gujrat and if dealership comes under capital of Gujrat then it will be better for us. All other car?s service center are only 5-7 kilometer far from Gandhinagar but Infinium Toyota is around 25-30 kilometer far from us. We have to think before purchasing vehicle that we have to travel 25-30 kilometer for service. So maybe people are not buying Toyota products because in the starting I was also able to buy Toyota car but I was not buying because of service center. I was thinking like who will go to Ahmedabad for service and we cannot do service at any other station. Then I was strongly thinking to buy this car. So I purchased this car. If service center will be locate here, then I may purchase this car 5 year ago. Other everything is good about service only location should be in Gandhinagar city.
Location is out of city, it should be in city. The showroom is our side and we purchased the car once but we have to go there most often for servicing.  Chikhalthana and MIDC area is having such type of transportations as pick up and drop facility is having there. We want to say about servicing but how can we say as we have to go there. 
Dealership and service center distance is very high, it should be nearby.
Location should be near 
Actually improvement is not there but your location where I am doing my car servicing it is out side of the city. My problem is that only and nothing else.  I don't think they will open it inside of the city.  It will be ok if it is near by city.  Their location is far way.
Dealership location is available almost 40 km from Jaipur. So I thought they should arrange showroom at nearby Jaipur city.
In Om Toyota workshop or in near by area canteen facility is not available.  If customer want to have some food or want to go out so there is no vehicle available.  Their location is almost 150 Km far away from my location.  It is very time consuming to traveling there.  If their location would be on Agra road or Tomak road then it will be good. 
Dealership location should be on road of Chandigarh and Patiala.
In Delhi road also there is lot of place where there is showroom. In Rampur also they had open showroom which is totally different. Whatever the showroom are available in Delhi all are beside the road which is very good. 
At Infinium Toyota only distance should be little reduce. Their charges are reasonable they don?t even charge much from us but service center is little far that is only issue we have. If it will be near to Rajkot city, then it will be better. Construction wise location is good but distance is far from the Rajkot city. 
Toyotas maximum customers are from city area. If the service center will be located in Basistha or Chariali then it would be good. If Toyotas location is also like Fords and Audis location then it will be good. Presently the service center of Toyota was in the End of Bypass because of this city people have to face problem.
Now your showroom in which area that are area is in near to Gandhi ham main center area which is little far. Other company?s dealerships are near by 2-3 kilometers only but your dealership is far. Now they cannot do anything for that but.
Dealership location should be nearby from the city. Rajendra Toyota is available at Industrial area. Like if customer want to go somewhere else so options are not available. Whatever available it all only at showroom but out side nothing. If customer want Auto or Taxi so it is little far.  Also if we want to for in the City for some work so for this it is taking long time.
Dealership location is located far away from my house i.e. 15 KM thus its very much difficult to me to reach there and come back. Even they as well do not give any pick and drop facilities to its customers. In my area all the car owners are having this issues. Hence the Toyota Dealership need to relocate their dealership shop in City (Town) area.
Annamalai Erode dealership is located in Out of city bypass road. It would be good if they locate the same with Showroom
Dealership location is little far for me. Dealership is in Ajira area and I am living in Varchha village. Dealership is 30 KM far from my place so it will be better if dealership will be only 10 KM far. Dealership is far for me.
Dealership location is too long it?s about 20 KM long. Need locate it nearby.
There is new dealership branch at Kozhikode Jilla but till now it was not opened completely. Hence they need to concentrate and do not leave it simply and need more service centers like this and at Kozhikode Nadakkavu, Elathur and Palankadi in these palaces need dealerships branches.
They should improve the servicing parking area.
Dealership location should be available between Kottayam and Ernakulum place and one dealership should be available at Cherthala area
They should sign borad of dealership on the corner of the road.
If location is nearby then it will good. It is almost 90 km from my location It should in Jodhpur nearby 50 km so it will better.

Dealership location is not much good, we round up the whole city and reaches at end. It would be good to open a new dealership at Thamarashery Kozhikode medical college place.
Dealerdhip location should be near by highway.
Lanson Pondicherry Dealership is located far from my place 15 KM. It would be good if they can locate it in main place.
They need open service center in Aurangabad Cidko MIDC area. Sharayu Toyota is a one of the best Toyota. It is very necessary in MIDC Aurangabad  because its to far for city person to go out of the city just for the servicing of the vehicle. 
Dealership location is very long in my area so they should open the dealership in my area that very help for me.
Service center little far away. It should be in Neral .
From my place to dealership the distance is around 19 KM. Hence I couldn?t reach there on the committed time of appointment. It would be good if they locate a dealership at Ramanathapuram.
They should improve the location area because the road of the dealership was not good it is very far away from my house. The dealership area was outside the side if it will be inside the city then it would be good.
If there was a dealership in between the Cuttack and Bhubaneshwar then it will be good.
They should repair the road of dearship
If there was a service center in Raigarh area then it will be good.  We don?t find the Innova car parts nearby. We have to go far away for getting the parts.
I reside in Thoothukudi and to service the car I had travel till Tirunelveli. Hence, we need dealership in Thoothukudi as well.
They have to provide the another dealership at Vijayawada 
The problem is on the road. The dealership would be on the other side of Shillong. It would have been better because the congestion is too much and we take so much time on the road because of the location. Traffic is a big problem for location of Shillong. It should be in the Eastern other than Southern side of Meghalaya/shilling. The area about Summit is good for it.
Dealership area is 450 km far away from my house if it will be Raigarh area then it will be good
location should shift in better location as it is not convenient , its not heart of the locality. It can be better place like near airport
If service center will be increase, then it will be better. In Surat one service station is in Adajan & another one is in Hajira. Actually we get good response from them. They should open one more dealership in city area. I don?t have much headache for that but if anyone wants to buy a car then they face problem in servicing I think because of this reason people don?t buy cars that they have to go Hajira for service. More 2-3 service station need to open.  We are satisfied with the services at Hajira. Innova is successful car but for service we have to travel more for this company should give us more options. Centre should be increase. If they will open dealership at Mandoli or Kamrej road or Barboli area otherwise Varachaa then will be good. At varachha they have showroom so they should open dealership servicing with that. It will help nearby people a lot. 
They have to provide dealership location at Gajuwaka 104 area.
They should open a service center in Daruheda.
In Faizbabad there is only Toyota agency. The Toyota service center is 200kms away from Faizabad and 80kms away from my house. I have to come all the way to Lucknow for servicing. The service center in Lucknow is always crowded and the travelling cost sums upto 2000Rs. Their service center should be within 100kms.  
Service center should be in Balabhgarh
There is no space in Andheri dealership showroom so they should increase the space. 
1. The location of the dealership is so far from the city
Dealership location was very long in my area. Around 5 to 6km If they are open dealership in my area that is good for me.
The place where they have their location it is very traffic area. Lots of traffic is there while going there or returning.  There is no highway connectivity. We are facing very difficulties to reach there.  They should shift the service center in open area or they should call and should give pick up & drop facility.  Should inform as sir will pick up your car on this time and will drop it on that time.  It should on 3-4 KM distance. The location having on which road it all are congested area. 
After servicing when they hand over our car and if we want do some other work in it we cannot do that work. If it would be done then it will be good. The car parking area is also very small. They should improve these things.
We think that we are living in Vasna Road and your dealership location is in Makar pure which is little far from here so if dealership comes little close then it will be good for us. They should locate dealership in some nearby area.
The location is far from where I stay it should get changed .If it could be near then it would be nice .DSR servicing is not there at PCMC . Pick up drop happen . But physically we want to go then they do not come at PCMC or Pimpri Chinchwad . If pimpri service station get opened so it will be profitable. Here there is Sharayu Toyota showroom but we don't knee much about it .We like DSR servicing .
Dealership location should be near.
Dealership location somewhat far and have to travel 45 KM. The current location of Amana Toyota is not much good have issues by going there and returning from there. Should open a new dealership in City place and also it would be good to open at Kasaragod. 
I reside at Dindigul and for servicing I have come Madurai after travelling 80 KM distance. Thus my whole day is wasted on this. After a long time even there is no Hotel facility, hence we feel bad about this. 
One thing Anant Toyota can improve like they can make showroom in the city. Currently city is 8-10 km far away. Second thing you can do this thing pick the vehicle from home and drop at the home without service. 
I reside in Nagarkovil and I have to visit till Tirunelveli for servicing the car and it takes 1 and half hours. Need a service center at Nagarkovil. 
There is so long to reach the Poonamallee dealership. It would be good if they locate it in Ekkattuthangal. 
We have travel 20 KM to reach the dealership. After leaving the car as well there is no bus facilities. Hence, they can locate the dealership within 10 KM distance. 
At Harsha dealership the car parking area is too small hence they need to make it more spacious. 
Jamnagar Mahanagarpalica is a big city. We have many big industries in our city like Reliance, SR, IOS, Hindustan so it is our only requirement. Not a dealership but at least we need a sub dealership here in Jamnagar. If you now check in Jamnagar, you will find many Toyota customers here in city and everyone has only one dealership for service at Rajkot. They should at least introduce a sub dealership by understanding our requirements. I have told this to company as well it will benefit us in the distance of 95 KM for each service. You can open a dealership in Jamnagar but if in Jamnagar it is not possible then they should open a dealership at Rajkot-Jamnagar highway. As Maruti have already having 3-3 workshop & showroom on that road. If you open your service station at Rajkot-Jamnagar highway near Pendha then we have to go by ring road side and on that road have much traffic which takes more than 1-2 hours of time to cross that road. 2 hours in the morning & 2 hours in the evening it takes to reach service. If we want to go from showroom we have to take delivery of car from showroom on correct time because after 6 traffic is very high on that road this is the reason I am saying a substation is required in Rajkot-Jamnagar highway. At Jamnagar hey have many customers of Toyota for them they need to think. Only Toyota?s workshop is not available at Jamnagar other all workshops are there in our city. Nexa Maruti also open a new dealership here. 
Location of service center should be  near by. The service center is 12-13 KM way from us. Due to traffic on such roads we faced lot of problems.  It should be situated within 5 KM range. 
Service centers should be open more it will better. Maximum 2 dealerships is available in Thrissur districs.sevice centers should be more open its not sales sport only service spots.
1. They way is not good for dealership 2. They have to provide reading books and water at waiting room
If they could arrange to come to different town like movable service center, we have lots of Toyota car here, if they come for servicing after every six months or one year, They do not have to open a shop but if they come then it would be nice.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

It should be inside of Satara city. Other dealerships are near by city like Hyundai, Maruti  due to this our time is saving. 
Dealership can locate in city town area instead of outer area. We face issues when reaching the dealership. After leaving the Car we face difficult as there is no facility of pick and drop. Even the bus facility is also not available in that place. The dealership should make arrangement of Pick up and Drop facility to its customers.
Dealership location is little far.Dealership location should be change from Jamshed pur to Distupur Or Skachi.
location far away from me. one more dealership should open. because I sty in Mansarovar. 30 to 35 Kilometer far away to me for went to Vikai service center from Mansarovar. that's why little far away to me this location. They should open one service center in middle of Jaipur then the all sides of customers will have visited this service center only. if any new service center they open then He must be open the service center 10 kilometers away from my house
The dealership location is situated in highway, They should open 1 more dealership in Virar East. Other company dealer ship is available there only Toyota dealership is not there.
The dealership location is in congested area it should be in open area.
Location is very far to go and come from there. That area is far for me. Company provides service also for that for pick up & drop of your vehicle by drivers. Company provides many services but location is far for some and near to some. In real they should come near by location area because location is very much far.
Location should be centralize. Transport facility should be available.  If we want to go by which train or which bus then extra car should be available for drop.  In Kalyan city they are having very nice location.  If I dropped my car to your place then I can  go by train as well.  same as if I want to go or Shilphata or thane then might be will face problem.  So it would be easy for customer. 
They should open the dealership in Pathankot also
Dealership location is long hence it would be good if they have it in town areas.
Dealership location is situated in Vasai & Nalasopara high way, I was facing problem to travel there. For servicing there is more difficulty of pickup & drop. Their is no other source of travelling. Its location is very inconvenient to travel. My 2-3 hours was waste to travel there. If dealership location is situated in city area so it will easy to accessible for the customers. Customers need to travel the Nalasopara west or till Vasai highway because it is located in Vasai entrence.If we want to go there we have to change at least 3-4 auto rikshaw.There is no other source to travel there if we give our vehicle for servicing then there is no other vehicle to come back to our place we face the difficulty if we drop or pickup the vehicle from there. The location is easy to accessible for customers & dealership will located in city limits. Where the customers can easily travel & we also found the other vehicle easily. There is no difficulties for pickup & drop facility.
They have to provide the service center near to the Kushaiguda.
Location is very far an only 1 dealership is available there. Service center area is very small. There is parking place problem, its place should be enlarge otherwise they should open 1 service Centre. The service center is situated out of the city & its very far its wasting time.
location should be in Pune or nearby city. Current location is 25 km away which should be within 10-15 km as it would be better for us. Dealership would get good business from this
 Number of dealership is less so it should be increased. We need to wait when we go to the service center. So if the dealership increases then the waiting will also be less.
Dealership location should be near by city.
They should open one showroom on highway it will be convenient for us. They should start one service center on Bombay banglor highway.
I come from Chidambaram to do service at Lanson Pondicherry. After 75 KM of travelling I have to come here. Hence it would be good if they locate a dealership at Cuddalore
Location need to improve little. Location is 10-12 KM far from our place. There are 2 location of dealership in Ahmedabad city which both are far from our place. May be Toyota don?t give dealership in city area. We have popper highway area in Maninagar & Narooli. They can open dealership here. 
First of all, that location is on upside. We have to go wrong side to reach the location. Road which is under construction now we have to go from that road to reach service centre. We have to go on wrong side and even there is no opening on highway. If we want to go from right side direction, we have to turn from too far. Location needs to change which is not possible so there should be crossing on highway. There is national highway on main line. We have to go around 200 KM and after that we have to go more 2 KM inside. So there opening should be change or location should be on right direction. 
The location of the service center is very far. The car consumes Rs.2000 diesel for the entire journey. Then there are additional charges for driver too. If Toyota opens a service center in Raigad Alibaug it would be really convenient for the nearby Toyota customers. The Toyota service center should be situated 50kms within Alibaug. Alibaug is a big city and Toyota should think about opening a service center here.  
Dealership should locate at town place and it would be better. The office also should make some advanced so that the customer feels comfort
The location is very far. There aren't any cars available for dropping and getting the car from the service center. The service center is located 25kms ahead from the Toll Plaza. Their service center should be within 5-7kms inside the city which is convenient for everyone. The location should be as such that the customers can easily drop off their cars and go back home.
Dealership location is out side of our town.  Private cabs like Ola and Uber are there.  They are delight because it the showroom comes on highway and  Dhanbad is in which place its in town there is no showroom available. Other companies showroom is available in side of the town.  But this far way from highway.  We are facing some problem in that for traveling.  If they are able to open their 2nd unit inside the town so it will helpful for other people also. In town any middle location will do it should be maximum 4-5 KM  or 10 KM that is also fine but it was far way. 
Annamalai Tiruppur dealership is located at outer part area and it should be located in City main area
All the dealership location should locate in official areas. 
There should be an indication of the dealership on the main-main roads. I stay 250kms away from Jabalpur. Jabalpur is municipal city and the dealership point of Commercial Toyota is in Tilwara. In Amarkantan-Jabalpur road, there should be proper indications as to where the right and left turns are to be taken. This would help people find their way to the dealership point. This should be done all over India. The local people would know how to go to Commercial Toyota but people who come from outside wouldn't understand roadside. Or the Toyota should launch a mobile app for the customers which connects through the mobile GPS system. The Dealership location shouldn't be in the out area. Every company's dealership should be located in the same area itself. E.g.: In Chhattisgarh Vilaspur city,all dealerships are located in one area. This system isn't available in the other cities. In mobile apps,there should be proiper indications or sign boards for the dealerships.                                   
There is a toll tax in front of dealership location.  We went for servicing so we have to pay toll tax of Rs. 150.  Should do some arrangement for toll tax because location can not change. 
The showroom is in the interior and becomes very difficult to travel there as it is out of the city. The other shops of Wasan is in Govandi and Vashi and it is odd for us to travel till there. They should put up a work station for Panvel station or Panvel bus stop.
The service station is outside Kolhapur and is 10-15kms away from my place. Therefore there are lots of problem while going there. There should be a service center in Kolhapur  even if its 1km away, it would still be convenient for us. The one which I go to is on the Highway and is far away.
Mostly they need to improve in the location. Location is too far. Lots of traffic is there. They should start pick up & drop service till location of Infinium Toyota.
The dealership is too long and far away for me. No dealership is available at Tambaram hence, need to locate a new dealership there.
Commercial Toyota should open an outlet in the city. Other service centres are almost situated far away from the city. Commercial Toyota is 15kms away from my place. Dealership should be within the city itself. Earlier there was a dealership outlet in my city but don't know why it has been shut down now.
Location should be nearby to Dwarka.
Location was near by but while traveling there that time we faced lots of traffic because of it time was waste location should be have nearby to at my home .They can have there service office in suber 2 or 3 loaction.On the way started a metro work .because of it there are lots of traffic
Rajendra Toyota location was too far. We leave the car there itself for servicing. There is no facility for going and returning. It has more problems because it is far from city. Allahabad was 125km far from my house and 15 km far from Allahabad. If they open near shorav service center it is 20-25km nearby. Whenever we are leaving our car in Rajendra service center there is no facility for transport.   It should be there for betterment because of that I was frustrated if we are leaving our car in showroom then we needs to go with our car. This is the problem in rajendra Toyota
Location is outer from city. They haven?t arranging any solution for this. We are travelling so far. While returning from there we have lots of problem. They should solve this problem.
The location center is as outer from city. Because there is no bus facility over there. There should be bus stop facility in dealership nearby even there the bus never stands.
There should be one Toyota service center nearby Chakan.
They have to provide the service center in between the shamshbad and Arranger chowrasta areas.
In Navsari should be have location for work shop for emergency work in Navsari have any workshop so there should also open a workshop Honda or Suzuki workshop had in Navsari but there had no any Toyota workshop for Compton so Toyota should open a worship indifferent different location in Navsari.
Dealership location should be inside the Bhivadi.
Location so far away. So it should be in Itava or UP.
The location center is too far from town. The ladies used to wait there but pick-up and drop facility was available there since the problem was not there. If the service center is in town it will be fine. They should open the service center in town also.
I want dealership in Nagercoil; Tirunelveli dealership is for Honda, Nizan, Maruti company are there but Toyota dealership is not there the people in Kanyakumari are high settled they need Innova and for tuner but dealership is not there in that  place because of that they are not buying.
We not get parking over there when I was visiting there 2 times my car to by tactic police. Proper parking facility should be available over there. Showroom should have place for parking there is road so we have to walk for 2-3 km for parking.
The dealership location was far for me. For me the location was 60km far. I used to cross the town to dealership. If the dealership is at district head quarters will be more convenient. And this is a sales point also and needs to be serviced properly. At this location there is no service center.

At ?Lanson Kanchipuram? dealership only one ramp for servicing our car so one cars servicing finishing after they are taken other car for servicing hence, should be in existed ramp for servicing our car. It will be good for us.
Location is far away from me. In Noida there should be 2 or 3 more service center. Service center location should be at nearby  5 km.
Automotive location was at Satan. From here it was 50-60km far. Local service center are also not available over here. If the service center opened near local area it will be better for us. MP Viva near service center should be available. But now where the service available is fine but there is no service center in local area. from here to travel till Satan is far.
They we are Sitting in the Waiting Room, there is no person to respond , on us 
Axis road condition was very bad, so it should be repair.
They have to provide the dealership location at Jubilihills Abids 
Dealership location should be improved. Dealership location should be at Vasant kunj or Vasant vihar.
1) I stay at Tempura in papaya Patti on that we have to travel at 250 KM for dealership purpose. Service center must be there at Tempura then it is better for us. 2) As compare to another company if we travel long for dealership then they provide money for easel in the travelling purpose. But Toyota Company not proving easel charges. 3) Dealership center must be providing good quality food some people are facing problems.
I stay at Vilaspur it is 250km far away from service center. So we not think to visit there much. They built TD Toyota camps. So we visit there for servicing location is far away so I am dissatisfied. They should open service center at Ambikapur camp servicing is not sufficient compare to service center machines are not available here. So my suggestion is they should service center at Ambikapur. We have spend 1500 to reach Vilaspur & for servicing again 1500/-. So the expenses are more up to Rs.3000/-TD Toyota should open service center with one office one person is here of sales at Ambikapur.
Which location have which is far away to us. Location will have in last area.
The service center should be open at Salem city it will be fine for us.
The service center should be Ludhiana city.
Dealership location is too far .if it is 10 Km far is fine for us.
They should open new showroom at Masrur, Makhmallabad & ATO. Because of express highway bridge this showroom come under the bridge. Gangapur road is at 5 minute distance this road is good for the customer of Pimpalgaon, Ozargaon, Yevale. They should open work shop at Makhmallabad it will be good for the customer. Traffic is less over here. So they should give priority to this area. Maruti have small service station over there. If you open showroom over here then customer will get good service.
Dealership location should be have nearby sachet.
Area should be increase of this location because cars parks are park on road & space is very small.
No improvement require
Location is far away from my home it should be nearby at international airport all company?s service centre are over there otherwise it should be at Bodhguya.
Location is far in Pathanamthitta nearby they start one dealership. I purchased a car from Thiravalla. Location should have in Panthalam another then a door.
Wasan Toyota dealership is very inside there is no facility for coming and going. The location should be at main area and nearby. In dealership the customer only get coffee and tea if the customer is leaving the car for servicing they should give break fast facility to the customer. There is no facility for food and no hotels available nearby the location. The location should be at outer position and it should be nearby the road side in which the sales will be increase and the customer also gets the good service.
If the dealership is at Nagercoil then it will be good. We use to take separate time for service. In Nagercoil There is more showroom of other company so there should be one showroom of Toyota also.

Location should be like this when customer brings car to service center. He reached safely to the center. The Azamgarh area is not proper for the driver to drive the car.

Yesterday only my car was in servicing as one cable was not working & the fill was of Rs.16, 000/-. They didn?t give any % discount. They should provide some % for regular customer in Infinium.

I am staying in Mardhgao & the Toyota service center is located in Vairna. This location for me not so far only bit far for me. Toyota has some dealerships in certain locations like Vairna & other places. I don't think they are in position to put any service center in Mardhgao. Unless they out source it to somebody else. If they are able to out source it to somebody else like how Maruti brand do? then it will ok. They will have to do that because now they sold so many Toyota cars. it will take time so many cars come to one service center for servicing. If I am also come & tell them I want my car back in the evening that time they are unable to give my car back in evening at same day. from that point of view they will out source it they have something closer to Mardhgao then the workload on main service center will be less.

The first thing there is no location of Toyota. The regular service which is done is of no use. I am telling you that any of the workshops of any vehicle, like 2 wheeler, 3 wheeler or 4 wheeler the work is done properly there. Think like you had taken a car of Maruti, so in workshop of maruti only maruti cars are standing there so the workshop of Toyota should also be in proper area. We had purchased the car from Aravali & it is 650 km distance of Aravali from our place. We are having Udaipur nearby so a workshop of Toyota should be open in Udaipur. A good dealership location.

Customers are coming to you from long distance like Bhandara Amravati so, you may have all the record and you know that which part the car sales more so you should open service center at that place. You don?t have showroom at Varadha and Yavatmal if there is service center nearby then people who come from Chandpur it will be suitable for them they will not face problem of traffic. I take car from Yavatmal but service center is not there. So I have to come 150 to 200 km to Nagpur. It is at Kamatee and we have to spent full day.
Dealership location should be nearby to ring road.
No improvement require
First Frontage improves which location is there it is at building area so for customer for car parking they don?t have place.

Otherwise safety for the customer who their coming & going out also for especially you can take write turn really there problem.
