correct other places are very clean like millennium toyota all that there service areas all that much better than lakozy .
in service center was waiting area was rough and also not for driver class we done the 10000 servicing instead of waiting area has no space customer wait outside while servicing in waiting area has only 4 5 sofa area was so less in servicing take 3 4 hour so that why they should be provide wi fi facility there have no person to ask for water and also toilet was unclean .
at the time of last 2 servicing news paper are not in one place it was scattered .
they should provide net facility at waiting area .
