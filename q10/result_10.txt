feedback should not be so long . these should be only yes or no of questions . they should not waste customers time
they are not doing feedback call after servicing . they should call us ask us you are not facing any problem \? everything is ok \? servicing is done properly or not like that .

if customer will tell any problem then should give good response .
we told them our cars problem , after servicing our car they should be given the information about our cars problem solved or not , so we are understanding .
when they call for feedback and if the customer has any problem the dealership center should update it and if the customer visits next time they need to solve the problem
after servicing they did not call me . if they should tell the sells boys to call then it would be good .

last time my experience was good . but prior to that once i in the feedback call i had told them some improvements to be done that they have not done yet . also they took more time than the time committed by the company . i had shared these 2 feedbacks with them during last to last servicing . so they filled it but no action was taken . again i got a call but i do not remember what happened after that . this improvement must happen that at least when you are taking my feedback then action should also be taken . if any work is not done , then they must call the customer and tell them about the work not done . if anything is missing at dealership , then that must be informed to the customer and must complete the work .
they should not tell us forcefully to give good remark in market research feedback calls .
if customer complained about servicing quality , then they should properly done it and need to checking again after returned to the customer .
they should give revert of the feedback they taken from the customer and should improve it so that customer will not face the same problem again .
they should solve the customers problem as per the follow up calls .
we don \? t get follow up calls from them . they don \? t provide sufficient information to customers . if they give limited customer to each employee , then follow up will be proper . as your employee have overload with customer no one feel satisfied . for this you should increase the staff . they cannot do anything due to work overload . work load is high and staff are few at this place why company don \? t take further decisions .
they should give feedback call to the customers . they should take efforts to ask the customers if they liked the services or not . they should do a follow up of the request or problem of a customer . they only say that they will take care of the matter but they do n't do anything . suppose if i have sent my car for servicing , they should do the work but they never do it properly . when i complain them about it they always tell me the same thing that i wo n't have to face this kind o inconvenience in the future . they did not do my work and it got carried forward to the next servicing . they should always implemnet on the customer complaints .
they should give a follow up call to the customers after the servicing . they should ask the customers if they are satisfied with the services , if there is any problem in the car . of they are charging extra , they should ask the permission that even if the car is in warranty but if you get extra work done , the amount will be charged . they should inform the customer about the extra amount they are charging . if you do the servicing without asking , clean the car doors and charge rs . 500 without informing , that 's not right . customers should always be informed beforehand .
if customer mention his problem on follow up calls so they should resolve it .
there should be an improvement in the after sale services . the service center people should ask detailed questions regarding the car . the questions which they ask are very generalized . the questions which they ask in the feedback call is very general . the questions should be little more specific in the feedback calls .
in feedback call should be improve after servicing which feedback call we get if customer have some problem so they should solve if they tell some problem or some problem remained by company side so they should sent some person but they tell you have to come here .
we get feedback call but it had no meaning . if we given a feedback in it had some 2 or 3 paint , for it i am not satisfied they only response in call put after that they not do follow up . if we request something in a call after that we didn \? t get any response . which have not meaning there is have no second dealership and no body have there to listen us \? we have no time so much also . they done a work according to them self have no meaning to tell them they should understood problem of a customer and improve it .
1 \) the service center take feedback from the customer and they should work on that . if there is only problem in servicing they should recall the customer again to solve it . and they should solve it . then again the same issue call came the staff wo n't on that complaint . if you are committing on anything that needs to be complete .
they should not call customer for feedback in office time . they should give us from so we can feel and give it to them so time will not waste because of your long questions . because of your question we get bored we are busy in other work . so they should give us forms instead of phone call .
at servicing the database is updated for the customers . because they should call to the customers and inform them when you need to come for servicing the car and after the servicing also the call needs to come and ask . how was the service . is their any problem with the car .
i face some problem in my car i told them about the same on call but after that they did not call me reply me for it . there was noise coming from my car still that problem is not solved .
after servicing they should give some importance feedback . they should ask to the customer about the services it properly done or not . they should work properly as per the customer \? s satisfactions . for a single day there is 10cars coming in they need to ask about 4 5 6 about the customer and the colors satisfaction they should improved on this .
they should call to customer and ask them about the service how the service was done you have any problem or not .
they should do improvement in feedback call . only call ask about complaints not do any improvement in that then any meaning of this . they should not do only formulates . my car have alignments problem its one half month after servicing nobody came to take my car . they only said that we will send driver all . if they ask for complaints then they should solve it satisfied the customer . it is there reasonability

after servicing which feedback call we get , they should take action on it . which complaint given by the customer . which should be update in service center and also them self they should call us and tell your complaint are update now can come for a servicing .
follow up calls should be improved because sometimes 3 to 4 dealership staffs are call to me regarding car servicing purpose so it was very irritating for me .
when the called up the customer care they take their feedback regarding service experience . at that time if customers demands any customer care number , telecaller should listen to customer and answer their query instead of disconnecting the call .
which feedback call we get in this which problems given them they should take immediate action on it another then feedback call had no use . who taken feedback call , who should direct informed to a company and said such worked not completed to a customer that why customer was dissatisfied , so done a worked immediate . if such thing happened so we could think which call we get had some meaning .
they should fulfill their commitments and should give proper response to the customer .
they don \? t remember the time of follow up this is what i think . they might call to other but i have not received any call from them for follow up . i don \? t know they are calling to others or not . you need to make them remind properly for follow up calls which is very important . they should follow back to customers and they should get the proper training for this . they should call us for follow up within 48 hours or they should call us within 1 1 and half hour for follow up . follow up call should be compulsory complete by them this type of rules should be for them . they should take responsibility to this .
follow up calls should be improved because they are call so many times it is waste of our time . if any problems are there we can call message to service center otherwise they should arrange the complaint box in dealership . in my first servicing the car that time they are call above 100 times so that should be improved .
1 \) they have to take the feedback by doing follow up calls and they have to rectify the problems .
