they should not make customer wait for long time .
t make wait customers to wait .
after servicing when i visit to take my car they kept me on wait for 1 2 hr .
if we reached half an hour late as per appointment then they normally treated wait for a long time .
even after servicing we used wait .
they should increase the space of workshop and should give 1 time to customer and should not make the wait for the customer .
dealership takes more time for servicing hence waiting is also too long .
