there is no wheel allotment facility , we have to visit the other town for wheels
here the dealership is small as there is 2 car display only but service facility is not available so this improvement is needed .
the customers who are taking appointment for then it they given any facilities it will be good like the work should complete 1 to 2 hours .
there should be one canteen facility of break fast also .
sometimes when we send our drivers it is not possible to give the payment to them so that dealership should have an online payment facility where we can make payment within 1 second also now a days for some reason nobody do not accept the cheque .
i would ask them to take less time and give the sms facility .
they should provide pick up and drop facility .
in house facility needs to be provided to the customers .
