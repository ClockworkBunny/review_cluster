once there was small issue in my vehicle then i visited the service center .
they do not have any proper person to work upon it because the issue does not gets resolved in first attempt .
the turn around time they says it will take around 1 hours but i would say if they take 2 hours as well there is no issues but they totally take 5 6 hours to complete the service .
some time it will take more time due to some technical efficiency or some issues that is why i told him .
overall it is satisfied he can issue he will take more time and some issue then they will take 1 day more time after the schedule accepted time
they should take less time for solving small issues if there are more problems in the vehicle they can take more time .
i had to take the payment of 8 10 lakhs from bank i had to pay it to a clint but because of this servicing issue my work was not done .
i thought this if in my car has no major issue then also they take more time for the servicing .
in my car have no technical issue it is regular servicing so , they should hand over the car at 2 pm .
1 \) they have to do the fast service for small issues of vehicle .
they took 3 hours for minor issue of wire .
30 pm would be not issues for us but the timeline of 1 .
