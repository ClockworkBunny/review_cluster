when we call to fix an appointment for servicing they tell no appointment for today , tomorrow so on .
she replied me to fix a navigator machine that much time was taken .
they should fixed one time and on that time they should provide their vehicle , they says today service will get done and when we visit they says your vehicle will get tomorrow which is not good .
so instead they should already have the parts with them so they can fix it in less time .
they should give appointment to customer by checking time and service should be complete within fixed time .
i went at 12pm the work was done by 3 pm the work was just to fix front wheel to fix rubber .
the service appointment fixed after , then they taking our job card .
i am taking the appointment day only before i always take the appointment fix the time and go .
if i go on the fix time then too sometimes the ramp is not free .
all till now there is no problem but from 1 2 times are giving fix time .
i am fixed the appointment for car service at 10 am but they start servicing my car at 2pm , so one day i have to spend the time i have to take the leave from my office for this purpose .
day time not fix at dealership this not should be happen .
service appointment fixing should be limited .
