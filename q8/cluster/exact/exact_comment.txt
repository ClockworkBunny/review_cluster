so i told her that they should write the exact time .
eg they say come at evening to pick the vehicle but they do n't specify the exact time at what time to come .
they should improve it , they should tell the exact time .
then they start the work they should be start the work exact 9 30am then its not consume so much time .
that exact time customer will pick up the car after servicing .
they should update the exact time to the customer they need in servicing .
they should say the exact time to the customer .
they should tell us exact time for car service .
