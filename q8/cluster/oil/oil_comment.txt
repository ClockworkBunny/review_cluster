they did oil service checked the ac so for this they i had given my car at 10 .
for oil servicing they tell that it will take 2 to 3 hours if we give the car by morning they ask us collect it by 3 .
without oil changing they took 4 5 hours for servicing .
they should put oil immediately and solve it they should improve in main problem in the car .
they are taking too much time for oil change , wheel change alignment service .
like we give our car to change the oil and also change the diesel in 10 \?
they told us for normal oil service it will take one hour however they took 1 day .
for oil change the take more time .
